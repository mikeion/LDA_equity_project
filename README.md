# LDA_equity_project

In this project, we are interested in understanding the current conceptions of equity that emerge from a review of the literature.
In order to understand this systematically, we aim to use topic modeling to discover the latent “topics” that occur in a collection of equity-oriented mathematics education journal articles.

See the jupyter notebook for the code.
