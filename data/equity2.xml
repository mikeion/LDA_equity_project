        <ab>This study assesses the reliability of two observation rubrics, one in math and the other in science, and documents how the rubric data were used to inform a teacher education program. Classroom observations are typically considered essential for assessing teaching practice, yet many popular observation frameworks, while comprehensive in aim, do not appropriately capture key features of teaching valued by teacher education programs. Many of these tools do not attend to issues of equity, humanizing pedagogy, and thus, social justice. We report on the development of two observation rubrics-secondary math and science-that embody the aims and values of our teacher education program, specifically, equity and humanizing pedagogy, and the results of our examination of the reliability of ratings of teaching practice generated using these rubrics. We discuss the various sources of measurement error and the implications for further developing and using the observation rubric in our program.</ab>

        <ab>In their commentary, "Toward a Framework for Research Linking Equitable Teaching with the Standards for Mathematical Practice," Bartell et al. (2017) provide a steppingstone into the challenge of clarifying the interface between equity and standards setting in mathematics education by devising a framework that relates the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics to an explicit articulation of equitable teaching practices. In this commentary, we respond to this proposed framework and aim to clarify some key elements. Furthermore, we draw on our own positionings and scholarly interests to critique and bolster the framework by focusing on the tensions related to co-opting the Common Core for equity-oriented purposes, the framework's relationship to neoliberalism, and the role of racialized rhetoric and nondominant family and community knowledge.</ab>

        <ab>Mathematics classrooms are increasingly becoming sites for investigating social (injustice, but research on teaching mathematics for social justice remains limited to individual case studies. This article reports on a metasynthesis of 35 qualitative reports of social justice mathematics enactments in diverse classroom contexts. Critical race theory serves as a guiding framework for analyzing possibilities and limitations of these enactments to address racial inequities in mathematics education. Findings from this metasynthesis reveal that addressing race in social justice mathematics explorations provided opportunities for centering the voices of people of Color and critiquing liberal views that camouflage subtle forms of racism and involved substantial and authentic mathematical work. Promising practices and implications for future research are identified based on this synthesis.</ab>

Findings detail how this teacher views the relationship between mathematics education and social justice and how her conception of teaching for social justice is enacted in her mathematics classes. Interview data and excerpts of classroom practice are used to describe how the teacher negotiates 2 dilemmas in her teaching: the challenge of fostering students' independence/interdependence and the problem of dominant mathematics as a necessity/obstacle to social justice.</ab>

        <ab>In recent years, the notion of equity has become increasingly prominent in mathematics education, in relation to pedagogy and the opportunities provided for learners to identify themselves as successful mathematics learners. Different pedagogies have been shown to promote equity and access to mathematics in different ways. However, teacher practices are not characterised only by pedagogy, but also by social relationships between teachers and learners, which can be key in supporting all learners to identify with mathematics. Data are drawn from a study involving two teachers who taught using similar traditional pedagogies but had different social relationships with learners in a South African school. Data were collected over two years, in the form of videotaped lessons, field notes and audiotaped interviews with participants, and were analysed qualitatively. The relationship between different teacherâlearner social relationships and learners' mathematical identities suggests that different social relationships have implications for equity, shaping access to knowledge and learner identities in important ways.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, we provide a conceptual critique of the various constructs often used to justify policies and/or research to promote equity, diversity and social justice in science education. As research expands in these areas, we seek to provide some clarity to support researchers in deepening their work toward transformative goals in science teaching and learning. First, we explore the ways in which researches often argue why equity, diversity or social justice should be addressed, detailing arguments for economic superiority, morality and sociotransformative action. Next, we outline how researchers have argued that equity, diversity and social justice should be addressed including approaches such as equal distribution, mandated policy and sociotransformative education. We conclude with some examples of recent research that bring into practice the lesser known of these, the sociotransformative approach, arguing that this approach provides the field of science education research with a more promising way to create sustainable change. The sociotransformative approach is centered on improving the lived experiences of historically marginalized youth and encourages researchers to focus on reporting research as narratives of engagement. That is, a more representative and balanced analysis of the challenges and successes of teaching and learning in culturally diverse schools and of the responsive (and responsible) role researchers can (and should) play in helping bring about positive social change. This paper helps situate the other articles in this special issue in the larger conversations on equity, diversity and social justice occurring within the field of science education.</ab>

        <ab>This article draws on critical theories and perspectives on mathematics education to explain the tendency of mathematics teaching worldwide to remain focused on developing procedural understanding, despite repeated calls from the mathematics education community for a more relevant and engaging curriculum. It highlights how conventional approaches to teaching mathematics contribute towards alienating a high proportion of learners and reproducing inequities within society. The article reports on a participatory action research project, involving a group of mathematics teachers in secondary schools in England, who share a commitment for teaching mathematics for social justice. It demonstrates how, by reflecting critically on their own epistemologies and classroom practice in relation to an underlying theoretical framework, teacher researchers are able to negotiate the constraints they face in achieving this objective. Careful consideration of their relationships with students enables them to develop pedagogies that significantly heighten the engagement, and advance the empowerment, of students.</ab>

        <ab>This case study documents a professional learning community (PLC) comprised of urban elementary educators working toward equitable education for students with dis/abilities. We employ an equity-expansive learning frame to evoke and then examine tensions and contradictions that emerged during the PLC and mediated learning as evidenced by participants' expanded notions of equity. We introduced equity-oriented mathematics education content and tools based on what emerged from the PLC, then utilized an interpretive approach to analyzing data through a multistage process. Results indicate identity and power tensions that worked against equitable practices. However, participants recognized several tensions and proposed to address them as contradictions that mediated learning, thereby expanding notions of equitable education.</ab>

        <ab>Governments worldwide are advocating for STEM curricula as essential to economic viability but the opportunity for STEM to create a re-envisioned world where there is equal access to wealth, opportunities, and privileges is less prominent. The literature has also not clearly articulated how the combination of the individual disciplines areas: science, technology, engineering and maths should be structured to form a cohesive paradigm within a contextual real-world problem. This paper details one example of a STEM unit had with an equity and social justice agenda. The teacher orchestrated a range of learning experiences to develop student intellectual and emotional engagement with the learning experience sequence, which was to design a pair of shoes for students in a refugee camp using resources that might be available there. Her teaching approach involved the choreography of student attention to the different dimensions of STEM. While all were in play particular disciplinary concepts and practices were foregrounded at different times. We propose that teaching STEM involves a choreography of focus on the different disciplines of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths, with the relative weight at any one time and overall depending on the nature of the task that is to be accomplished.</ab>

        <ab>This mixed-method study examines the relationship between classroom discussion and student performance in twenty 3rd and 4th grade classrooms in northern California with 50% English language learners (ELLs). Discussions were scored on features including use of multiple approaches for solving problems, students' opportunities to speak, equitable participation, explanations, and connections between ideas. A linguistically-modified math assessment measured student performance. Quantitative analysis using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) showed that the discussion features variety of approaches and equitable participation significantly contributed to the explanation of between-class variation in assessment scores, above and beyond that explained by prior mathematics performance and English proficiency. Importantly, mathematical discussion was equally beneficial for students classified as ELLs and those not classified as ELLs. Two classroom vignettes illustrate the different features of discussion and offer insight into ways ELLs contributed to the discussion in different contexts.</ab>

        <ab>The role of language in mathematics teaching and learning is increasingly highlighted by standards and reform movements in the US. However, little is known about teachers', and especially early career teachers' (ECTs) practices and understandings related to language in mathematics instruction. This multiple case study explored the language-related understandings and practices of six ECTs in diverse elementary classrooms. Using iterative cycles of analysis, we found that all ECTs regularly attended to students' mathematical vocabulary use and development. Yet, there was variability in ECTs' focus on how to teach mathematical vocabulary, expectations for students' precise use of mathematical terminology, and the use of multiple languages during instruction. These findings indicate that ECTs need more targeted support during teacher preparation and early career teaching in order to better support all students' language development in the mathematics classroom.</ab>

        <ab>Many efforts have been made to reach educational equity, especially to reduce mathematics and science achievement gaps by studentsâ socioeconomic status. Across countries, educators strive to reform traditional teacher-centered instructional approaches to more student-centered/inquiry-based instruction to improve equity in education. In this context, this study examines whether relationships between socioeconomic status and scientific or mathematical literacy are moderated by student-centered instruction. Ten countries covering a wide range of achievement levels as well as equity in education are selected for an international comparison. A linear regression analysis is applied to student achievement, equity, and frequency of student-centered instruction data from the PISA 2012 and PISA 2015. We find mixed results: As student-centered instruction is offered more frequently, the gap in mathematical and scientific literacy between low and high socioeconomic status is generally narrowed or maintained. In most countries, studentsâ mathematical and scientific literacy scores are expected to decrease across all socioeconomic status as student-centered instruction is given more frequently. The findings necessitate further scrutiny of how teachers implement student-centered instruction in various educational systems. This further research need to consider the complexity of implementation related to sociological and pedagogical aspects.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reports on a study that aims to address the challenges of UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all. The study focuses on school mathematics in particular. With regard to ensuring equitable access to quality education, it is argued that there is a need to consider the epistemic quality of what students come to know, make sense of and be able to do in school mathematics. Accordingly, the aim is to maximize the chances that all pupils will have epistemic access to school mathematics of high epistemic quality. The study is based on the theoretical framework of Joint Action Theory in Didactics (JATD). Associated research questions focus on the quality of teacher-student(s) joint action and on the epistemic quality of the content. The paper draws on empirical research findings of the Developing Mathematical Thinking in the Primary Classroom (DMTPC) project (2010â12) and also on the findings of a parallel study of mathematics teachers' assessment practices in Ghana. One teacher's action research project is used as an exemplar to illustrate how mathematics can become more accessible and inclusive thus leading to an evolution in mathematical thinking and high-quality epistemic access for all.</ab>

        <ab>This article outlines several forms of instructional practice that distinguished middlegrades mathematics classrooms that were organized around conceptually oriented activity and marked by African American students' success on state assessments. We identified these forms of practice based on a comparative analysis of teaching in (a) classrooms in which there was evidence of conceptually oriented instruction and in which African American students performed better than predicted by their previous state assessment scores and (b) classrooms in which there was evidence of conceptually oriented instruction but in which African American students did not perform better than predicted on previous state assessment scores. The resulting forms of practice can inform professional learning for preservice and in-service teachers.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, the authors present an analysis of two views of culture reflected in equity scholarship and their implications on research and mathematics teaching. In doing so, they draw on two interrelated theoretical orientations to describe instructional practices that support equitable learning opportunities in mathematics classrooms. These two orientations are grounded in contrasting views of culture. They discuss the contributions of and the tensions associated with each orientation, and argue for a research agenda that focuses primarily on what is called the Cultural Participation Orientation. In addition, the authors discuss the usefulness of drawing on both orientations in understanding equitable instructional practices in urban mathematics classrooms.</ab>

        <ab>Galvanized by organized communities, movements against mass incarceration have steadily coalesced and crept into schools over the last decade and a half. This political moment creates new opportunities for those working for justice in communities and in schools, and demands that subject-matter educators engage in this work. While there is a robust "reform" discourse within mathematics education, the field has been constructed as neatly outside the carceral sphere and remains relatively isolated from this burgeoning movement. This article draws on the authors' practices and bodies of research to explore mathematics as an agent of the carceral state and to imagine mathematics education practices may stop the state from harmingâincluding killingâBlack, Brown, queer, migrant, poor, and other marginalized people. The authors also consider how mathematics could be a core tool for an abolitionist movement.</ab>

        <ab>The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) do not make any promises about the teaching practices that should be used to support studentsâ enactment of the standards. Thus, equity gets framed as achievable through making the standards a goal for all students. We know from research on past reform efforts that standards without explicit (or companion) teaching practices, and teaching practices without explicit attention to equity, will inevitably result in the failure o f the standards to achieve goals for students. This commentary provides a framework for future research that hypothesizes research-based equitable mathematics teaching practices in support of the CCSSM's Standards for Mathematical Practice, connecting research, policy, and practice in order to realize the equity potential of the CCSSM.</ab>

        <ab>This article provides an example of, and lessons from, teaching and learning critical mathematics in a Chicago public neighborhood high school with a social justice focus. It is based on a qualitative study of my untracked, 12th-grade mathematics class, a full-year enactment of mathematics for social and racial justice. Students were Black and Latin@ from a low-income, working-class community with a tradition of resistance. Any neighborhood student could enroll without selection criteria. The class goal was for students to cocreate a classroom in which they would learn and use collegepreparatory', conceptually based mathematics to study and understand social reality to prepare themselves to change it. Through analyzing my practice, I address possibilities and challenges of curriculum development and teaching, examine student learning, and pose questions and directions for further research and practice.</ab>

        <ab>Highlights â¢ Latina mothers' conceptions of math centered on basic operations and daily living. â¢ Half the mothers enjoyed math and were positive about their math skills. â¢ Most mothers emphasized the importance of helping their children with math at home. â¢ Mothers used diverse activities to foster math, but not as part of a systematic plan. â¢ Findings are relevant for culturally-sensitive math interventions for parents. Abstract This study addressed the important role that the home plays just prior to or at the start of formal schooling, in facilitating children's math learning. Although research on home influences is a burgeoning area, there has been limited research, particularly in math socialization, with Latinx families, one of the fastest growing racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. Using a mixed-methods approach and data from 47 foreign-born Latina mothers of children in preschool through first grade, we examined mothers' conception of math (knowledge and attitudes) and their socialization (beliefs and practices) of children's math skills. The present study combined two empirical traditions, one based on mainstream conceptualizations of parental involvement and one that builds from cultural approaches to math engagement. The results are pertinent for developing intervention programs to improve young Latino children's math skills that capitalize on the strengths found within children's homes and that address their challenges.</ab>

        <ab>We investigated secondary science and mathematics teachers engaged in a two-and-a-half-year professional development effort focused on equity. We examined how teachers conducting research on their own instructional practices-a central learning strategy of the professional development project-informed and/or constrained their views related to three strands of equity: teachers and teaching, students and learning, and students' families and communities. Data collected included recordings of professional development seminars and school-site meetings, three sets of individual interviews with teacher researchers, and drafts and final products of the classroom research teachers conducted. From our qualitative analyses of data, we found that most teachers addressed at least two of the three equity strands in researching their own practice. We also found that most transformed their understandings of teachers and students as a result of their teacher research process. However, teachers' views of families and communities changed in less substantive ways. We close with recommendations for other researchers and professional developers intent on supporting science and mathematics teachers in using teacher research to work toward equity.</ab>

        <ab>We investigated secondary mathematics teachers' attitudes toward alternative ways of managing instruction on geometric proofs. Participants assigned to different experimental conditions viewed storyboard episodes of instruction. Some episodes showed instruction we hypothesized teachers would recognize as routine. Other episodes showed instruction that we hypothesized teachers would recognize as departures from routine. We found that, when participants were shown storyboards that represented what routinely happens in classrooms, positive and negative markers of attitude in their reactions to the storyboards occurred with equal frequency. But when presented with departures from routine, participantsâ reactions included significantly more negative than positive markers of attitude.</ab>

        <ab>Introduced in 2013 by the American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare, the Grand Challenges for Social Work (GCSW) implicitly embrace a public health perspective. However, the lack of a specific overarching conceptual framework creates a challenge for moving the GCSW from concept to practice. In this article, authors propose that public health social work (PHSW) provides a unifying framework for moving the GCSW from concept to practice. Authors undertook a review of the literature, including a review of published literature and all Web sites and other Web materials focused on the GCSW. Three GCSW were selected to illustrate the utility of PHSW and the social work health impact model (SWHIM): (1) stopping family violence, (2) eradicating social isolation, and (3) achieving opportunity and justice. Using a wide-lens PHSW approach, the illustrations focus on actions that can influence populations through strengthened environments and multilevel interventions. The public health field reflects the rigorous science behind the theoretical models, community-based approaches, and attention to effects of social determinants of health at the population level. Because health and inequalities are the focus of many of the GCSW, incorporating both public and population health, together with the SWHIM, can help provide structure to achieve collective goals.</ab>

        <ab>A 14-week course program was designed to investigate pre-service teachers' noticing skills and scaffolding practices. Six pre-service teachers were matched with a pair of sixth grade students to observe and scaffold students' mathematical understanding while they were working on the given tasks. Data was collected through pre-service teachers' own recorded videos of implementation of tasks, their written reflections about the implementations, videos of group reflections before and after the implementations, and students' written work. The analysis of data revealed that pre-service teachers mostly noticed students' errors and strategies during their interactions with students, they attended important instances about students' thinking and justified their reasoning for their comments in their written reflections. However, while interacting with students, they usually used low level scaffolding practices such as asking for clarification, explanation, and justification rather than attempting to elicit students' thinking and improve their understanding.</ab>

        <ab>In Bangladesh, despite significant progress in access, equity and public examination success, poor student performance in mathematics in secondary schools has become a major concern. An extensive review of research has shown that teachers account to a large extent for student learning and achievement gains. Although educational research has emphasised the importance of evaluating teacher effectiveness for improving students' achievement, few studies have measured teacher effect on students' achievement in Bangladesh and similar country-contexts. Thus, the purpose of the study was to investigate the value-added effect of mathematics teachers in secondary schools in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A cross-sectional cohort research design was employed, using a purposive sampling (N= 380) of all schools within the Dhaka Metropolitan City (DMC), extracted from the 5,867 schools under the jurisdiction of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE), Dhaka. Secondary source data for Junior Secondary Certificate (2010) and the Secondary School Certificate (2013) were obtained from BISE Dhaka and analysed using Education Value-Added Assessment System (EVAAS). The 380 schools of the DMC were ranked according to the calculated value-added score, and the top twenty schools identified. As the first study to evaluate secondary mathematics teachers' direct effect on students' mathematics learning in Bangladesh, it contributes important insights about teacher effect that can be used to inform the development of evidence-based policy and practice for improving teaching quality in Bangladesh.</ab>

        <ab>STEM Education is sweeping the United States, prompted primarily by the recent adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards. The surge in interest in STEM Education is beneficial for local schools and communities, and promises to positively impact students, teachers, school leaders, community members, and the future workforce. Unfortunately, inequitable hegemonic structures and practices limit urban students' access to knowledge, resources, and a comprehensive and fair educational experience. This article explores the STEM activities in place at the Center for Innovation in STEM Education (CISE), at a local university in greater Los Angeles. From a historical context, CISE data show that an approach to STEM education that focuses on serving underrepresented populations by creating a pipeline, can serve as an example for K-12 schools, universities, and educational leaders seeking equitable practices in the field of STEM education. We identify implications for leadership development for school leaders, teacher leaders, and districts.</ab>

        <ab>Using critical race theory as an analytical framework to examine White privilege and institutional racism, two teacher educators, in a rural predominantly White university tell counterstories about teaching for social justice in literacy and mathematics education courses. In sharing our counterstories in this paper, we, women faculty of color, challenge Whiteness and institutional racism with the hopes of: (1) promoting social justice teaching in order to globally prepare (pre-and-in-service) teachers and educational leaders to motivate and empower ALL students to learn; (2) dismantling racism to promote better wellbeing for women faculty of color; and (3) moving educational communities at large closer toward equitable education, which is a fundamental civil right. After analyzing the counterstories, we suggest that university leaders establish policies and practices to support (recruit, retain, and promote) faculty/leaders of color, not just mainstream academics. Working toward equity and justice, we strive to form alliances between Whites and Others.</ab>

        <ab>We examine (a) the development of 3 student learning practices (SLPs)âlistening, speaking publicly, and making and using recordsâthat are central to participation and engagement in academically ambitious classrooms and (b) the teacher's work supporting the enactment of the SLPs in the context of a summer mathematics laboratory. We identify assets that the students brought to their workâassets that can remain invisible and underused in modal classroomsâas well as the work the teacher did to support these SLPs through cueing, modeling, scaffolding, providing feedback, and defining the practice. We found that as the teacher taught these SLPs, she attended to individual student understandings, grounded the work in the subject-matter domain, and was equitable and ambitious in her instruction. Situated in practice, this analysis enriches the literature on SLPs and helps educators see the more complicated forms that participation and engagement can take in classrooms.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, I investigate the influence of the dominant culture characterizing mathematics education--which I term the culture of exclusion--on efforts to teach for equity. Analyzing a year of observations in an urban high school mathematics department, 1 found that this culture structured everyday instruction even for teachers who expressed strong commitment to equity and who participated in ongoing equity-oriented professional development. Through their classroom practice, the 4 focal teachers in this study often framed mathematics as a fixed body of knowledge to be received, and they positioned students as deficient, unintentionally excluding many students from rich learning opportunities. However, these teachers also asserted alternatives to the culture of exclusion, showing how resistance to this culture might take shape in everyday mathematics instruction.</ab>

        <ab>Recent work examining science test performance in the earliest grades of school has demonstrated that science test score gaps by race/ethnicity are apparent as early as kindergarten and that, in a number of cases, the racial/ethnic test score gaps in science are significantly larger than the corresponding gaps in reading or mathematics. This study explores the factors that explain the differences in the magnitudes of racial/ethnic disparities in performance on science standardized tests as compared to those in reading/mathematics. Drawing on nationally representative data from over 10,000 kindergartners in the 2010â2011 school year, this study employs regression models that examine the explanatory power of nine conceptual domains for explaining the "gapâinâgaps" or test score gap differences in science relative to mathematics or reading. Results indicate that the gapâinâgaps is relatively unchanged by the inclusion of many conceptual domains but that students' language and immigration contexts do explain substantial portions of the gapâinâgaps for Hispanic and Asian students. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>This article documents efforts to advance inclusive mathematics education practices involving the introduction of equity-oriented resources in state-level mathematics standards guidance documents in a Midwestern United States jurisdiction. We adopt a critical stance by looking at ways to interrogate available metatheories for these kinds of change-making processes. The guiding resources documented in the present article center on issues of difference. These issues are related to dis/ability in mathematics education standards and curriculum to not only raise teachers' awareness of constructions of difference in order to foster inclusive education, but also to promote critical self-reflections around ableism. Guiding resources are a means to support recognition of dis/ability difference as a source of multiple mathematical knowledge bases from which to learn and advance mathematics thinking. Yet, we also recognize the need to be vigilant about the complex interpretative contours and the relational dynamics at work throughout their various layers of implementation, assessment, and anti-ableist realignment. Accordingly, we reflect metatheoretically about three questions: How might concepts of access, achievement, identity, and power support teachers of mathematics in advancing inclusive practices? How do word choices in mathematics standards, curriculum, and practices dis/able students in classroom practices? What may we learn from the mathematics education experiences of individuals with dis/abilities and their families in the broad configuration of change-making dynamics of educational policies and teaching practices?</ab>

        <ab>This paper explores how teachers' collaborative conversations afford and constrain their learning opportunities, through the close analysis of an interaction between equity-oriented mathematics teachers who were working together. The analysis reveals that although the group seemed like an ideal professional learning community in many ways, the teachers were frequently caught in tensions between restrictive and inclusive discourses about mathematical competence. The existence of these tensions presented opportunities for the teachers to learn, but teachers' framings of their own collaborative work stifled these opportunities. This paper contributes to understanding the challenges of equity- and reform-oriented learning in teachers' professional communities.</ab>

        <ab>Background/Context: Despite calls for equity in education, the dominant mode of schooling reproduces hierarchies, positioning some students as bright, gifted, or fast learners and others as lazy, in need of remediation, or slow. A number of studies have shown that teachers' professional communities and networks can address this problem and enhance outcomes for all students. However, more research is needed not only to show the structure of supportive networks but also to explain the mechanisms through which they foster teacher learning. Research Questions: This paper addresses three questions: (a) Where do teachers encounter resources that support their engagement with nondominant, equity-oriented teaching practice? (b) What kinds of resources support teachers' engagement with nondominant teaching practice? and (c) How do different kinds of resources come together to support teachers' patterns of engagement with communities of nondominant teaching practice? Research Design: A multisite case study was conducted over the course of an academic year. The study involved extensive observations in routine teacher meetings and professional development settings, as well as classroom observations and teacher interviews. Participants: Participants included 18 mathematics teachers from two diverse urban high schools. The mathematics departments at both schools expressed commitments to professional learning and collaboration in order to better serve their diverse student bodies, in particular, to support students who had previously been unsuccessful. Six teachers were selected as focal teachers for more in-depth observation and interviewing. This paper describes the contrasting cases of four teachers. Findings: Two of the focal teachers maintained close engagement with nondominant, equityoriented practice throughout the period of the study, while two did not. A comparison of teachers' professional support networks showed that their patterns of engagement were related to their connections to sources outside their school-based communities and the access that these connections provided to four distinct types of resources. The two teachers who maintained their engagement with reforms were found to have abundant and personally significant identity resources, which were critical for their ongoing learning. Although the other two teachers had technical resources for engaging with reforms, they did not have such identity resources. Conclusions/Recommendations: Research and practice have tended to focus on technical aspects of teacher learning in service of reform. This paper suggests that teachers need not only more resources, but also more kinds of resources in order to sustain the learning that student-centered, equity-oriented reforms require.</ab>

        <ab>This article analyses what students attending four Swedish upper secondary school programmes with different social class profiles tried and wanted to influence in relation to mathematics teachers' pedagogic practice and responses during the year 2008/2009. The theoretical framework is based on Bernstein's theories regarding power and control. The analyses draw on ethnographic observations of classes taking the Natural Science and Social Science academic programmes, and the Vehicle and Child and Recreation vocational programmes, at two Swedish upper secondary schools. Students attending different programmes tried to influence the teaching. However, what the students taking the academic and vocational programmes were able to influence considerably differed. Generally, the vocational students exerted influence more successfully when they wanted to reduce the pace and difficulty of teaching, than when they wished to get more out of their education, while the opposite applied to the academic, especially Natural Science, students. Thus, the power relations reflected the programmes' social class profiles and the students' expected positions in society, despite policies at the time to promote democracy and reduce social reproduction in education. The findings support the importance of analysing not only students' voices, but also their voices in relation to the pedagogic practice they encounter.</ab>

        <ab>In this response paper to Hoyles' contribution "Transforming the mathematical practices of learners and teachers through digital technology" focuses on three points. First, more knowledge is needed on why teaching and learning practices should transform, into what will they transform, and by what or by whom will they be transformed. Second, a suggestion is made for a more specific taxonomy on the didactical functionality of digital tools in mathematics education. Third, a plea is made for a future research agenda that addresses the ways in which activities with digital tools mediate the learning of mathematics in a fruitful way. This includes the interpretation and grading of online student work through intelligent mathematical software, and the notion of embodiment, as to do justice to the bodily experiences in which mathematical experiences are rooted.</ab>

        <ab>Black learners are subject to systemic physical, symbolic, and epistemological violence in mathematics classrooms. Such violence has negative ramifications for Black children's mathematics learning and identity development. The authors argue that space should be made within the mathematics classroom to repair the harm caused by this violence. This article describes an identity-based curriculum, Mathematics for Justice, Identity, and meta-Cognition (or MaJIC), that provides a form of mathematics therapy through a restorative justice framework. The Silhouette Activity is highlighted as one approach that allows Black mathematics learners to engage in a restorative process of writing and drawing the internal and external messages they receive as mathematics doers and knowers.</ab>

        <ab>Student perceptions on teaching and learning are investigated in a side-to-side comparison between traditional (closed, CER) non-free course materials and free open educational resources (OER). The primary resources being compared are textbook and automatically-graded web-based homework systems. The results are based on a 32 item survey given to 103 Calculus students using either the closed (52 students) or open (51 students) materials. The survey is designed to assess student attitudes and perceptions in five areas: mathematics, learning style, effort, cost and OER. We conclude from our study that students believe they learn best from active or tactile activities (hands-on work in class, homework and tutoring) and least from passive or conceptual resources (textbook, lectures and notes). Secondly, the results show students perceive OER just as effective as CER, and would take free OER classes if given the opportunity, and the OER group more strongly held this belief. However, while students appreciate the cost-saving aspect of OER. cost of course materials is not a hardship and would not affect class choice or progress. A third aspect detected from the survey is that students who used the proprietary homework system (CER group) had a better experience and expended less time than those using the open homework system (OER group), in part due to the interactive help and support with the proprietary system. This is consistent with homework scores, which were higher in the CER group than OER group. We conclude from this study that students would prefer an OER course, and more strongly if they have previously taken an OER course, while care should be taken using OER to ensure an equally effective experience as CER. We hypothesize that a teaching style which focuses on active (tactile) learning is more effective than a focus on passive (conceptual) learning, and recommend OER be developed with this in mind.</ab>

        <ab>Michigan State University Background/Context: Large gaps in achievement and interest in science and engineering (STEM) persist for youth growing up in poverty, and in particular for African American and Latino youth. Within the informal education community, the recently evolving âmaker movementâ has sparked interest for its potential role in breaking down longstanding barriers to learning and attainment in STEM, with advocates arguing for its âdemocratizing effects.â What remains unclear is how minoritized newcomers to a makerspace can access and engage in makerspaces in robust and equitably consequential ways. Purpose: This paper describes how and why youth engage in making in an after-school, youth-focused, community-based makerspace program âMaking 4 Change.â Four in-depth stories of engagement are shared. Using a mobilities of learning framework, we discuss how youth appropriated and repurposed the process of making, and unpack how the program attempted to value and negotiate youthsâ ways of making from an equity-oriented perspective. Research Design: Utilizing a two-year critical ethnography, involving 36 youth over two years in two making settings, we assumed roles of both program teachers and researchers. Data collected included field notes, session videos, weekly youth conversation groups, youth created artifacts, and interviews. Analysis was iterative, involving movement between a grounded approach to making sense of our data, and a mobilities of learning framework. Findings: Three forms of engagementâcritical, connected and collectiveâsupported youthsâ sustained and mutual engagement in the makerspace. Across the three, it was essential to balance purposeful playfulness with just-in-time STEM modules, invite a broadening range of identities youth could draw on and perform, and to more critically address the affordances and constraints inherent in a community makerspace. Conclusions: From the insights gained, we suggest that framing youthsâ experiences through the lens of equitably consequential learning and becoming challenges the field to consider how makingâas a practiceâis always linked to individual and social histories that unfold across space and time. Who can make and who cannot, whose knowledge matters and whose does not, are all a part of making itself. But such understandings are not without tensions, for the work that youth do, which can invoke nontraditional tools and practices towards nontraditional ends, can be fraught with complexities that youth and adults alike are unprepared to handle.</ab>

        <ab>The Interactive Whiteboard (IWB) is now a common technological artefact in Swedish preschools and schools. This study examines preschool teachersâ thinking behind the embedding of IWB in the early yearsâ mathematics classroom and how preschool teachers structure their mathematical activities when using IWB. Two complementary empirical studies, that is, interviews and video observations, were conducted with four preschool teachers. The findings demonstrate that (just) having a positive attitude to technological artefacts like IWB is less likely to enrich the learning environment and lead to pedagogical change. This suggests that teachersâ IWB use is mostly informed by their pedagogical knowledge.</ab>

        <ab>Recently, pedagogical approaches have focused on creating arts-integrated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) or STEAM classes, which have drawn attention to the importance of the arts in science education. Despite increasing development and implementation of STEAM initiatives in science, there is limited discussion on the theoretical foundations, which could provide sound guidelines for science educators and teachers in planning and teaching STEAM curricula. In this paper, we set out the theoretical framework that explains and justifies integration of the arts and socio-cultural interaction into science teaching and learning. We explain in some detail the component theoretical elements and describe how these elements translate into teaching/learning practices in STEAM lessons. We conclude by re-emphasising the application of theoretical frameworks for the design of teaching/learning practices in an intercultural STEAM program.</ab>

        <ab>This study focuses on curriculum adaptation in Turkey where the school system is highly centralised, high schools are quite hierarchical, regional differences are intense, and a single, renewed curriculum is put into practice in all types of high schools that enrol students via high-stakes tests, unlike the Western context. Specifically, this multiple case study examines how and why five high school mathematics teachers in different types of Turkish rural high schools adapted the state-mandated curriculum. Interviews, observations, and documents were used to look for patterns and causes of adaptation. Findings revealed that although teachers do not disclose it in their plan, due to their lack of autonomy, they adapt the curriculum according to the perceived needs and attributes of students to cross over the 'brick wall' built by the Ministry of Education. Also, all the teachers use the same adaptation patterns that are 'omitting'; 'creating'; 'replacing'; 'changing the amount of time'; 'superficial teaching'; and 'using different sources/materials'. The reasons for adaptation and commonly used patterns are related to the perceived student profile, regulations, and nation-wide high-stakes tests. Consequently, suggestions are made to ensure curriculum does not end up as just written documents, and to prevent high-stakes tests from steering the instruction.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reports on a study carried out in Scotland which involved introducing the principles of Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) to 21 mainstream elementary teachers. It considers the effects of developing CGI in classrooms focussing on teacher learning and particularly their capacity to support all learners. The findings demonstrate teachers' awareness of their own learning and how increased understanding of children's mathematical thinking left them better placed to support all learners. The study highlights the importance of developing teachers' knowledge of children's mathematical thinking in order to promote inclusive practices with CGI providing a useful framework for this professional development.</ab>

        <ab>Student-centered instruction is featured in reforms that aim to improve excellence and equity in mathematics education. Although research on stereotype threat suggests that student-centered instruction may have differential effects on racial minority students, the relationship between student-centered mathematics instruction and student engagement remains understudied. This study examined the relationship between student-centered mathematics instruction and adolescents' behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social engagement in mathematics and whether the relationship differed by ethnicity. The authors used a multilevel path analysis with data from 3,883 sixth- to 12th-grade students (52.1% girls, 38.2% eligible for free/reduced lunch, 66.1% Caucasian, 23.8% African American, 7.2% multiracial, and 2.9% Asian American). The results showed that student-centered instruction was positively related to all dimensions of mathematics engagement. However, the positive association between student-centered mathematics instruction and student engagement was weaker for African American students. This study provides empirical evidence for the benefits of student-centered instruction while suggesting differential effects based on students' ethnicity.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to directly observe and investigate the factors that support or hinder the implementation of an integrated approach to formative assessment and to understand how the implementation of formative assessment strategies interact. The authors present findings from a collective case study that included the observation of six teachers (three mathematics and three English language arts) who were purposefully sampled from a large, public, suburban high school in the northeast United States. The analysis of the case studies resulted in the identification of different patterns in teachers' formative assessment practice. These patterns illustrate how the complex interaction between formative assessment practices can either support or hinder the implementation of an integrated approach to formative assessment and suggests classroom observations as a potential mechanism for identifying challenges and informing just-in-time professional development.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, we argue that science education is more than the high stakes, rigorous practices and methodology that students often find dull and uninspiring. We present that aesthetic and humanistic motivations, such as wonder, curiosity, and social justice, are also inherent reasons for doing science. In the MSUrbanSTEM program, we designed an approach that built on these aesthetic and humanistic aspects of science. We share three case studies to present everyday pedagogical approaches to science education used by three Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers during a school year. These classroom practices used wonder, curiosity, and social justice as motivations for engaging in science and provided a disciplinary lens to look at the world that students found to be fundamentally interesting and inspiring.</ab>

        <ab>ABSTRACT We investigated a 2.5-year professional development effort designed to support practicing science and mathematics teachers in understanding equity and enacting equitable practices. Our purpose was to inform the research base on effective equity professional development, toward the goal of better supporting science and mathematics teachers in transforming their views and practices. Because talk is central to learning, we examined how four strategies for professional learning facilitated or constrained teachers' shared equity talk: (1) engagement in teacher research, (2) reflection on personal experiences, (3) modeling of reform-based instructional practices, and (4) examination of school/state/national data on student course taking and achievement. We asked: How did teachers' shared equity talk vary across these strategies? To answer this question, we qualitatively analyzed recorded seminars, teacher interviews, and written reflections to determine the opportunities each strategy afforded teachers to talk about equity, and the length and substance of teachers' equity talk as a result. We found that, despite teachers' construction of a shared equity discourse and the iterative implementation of professional learning strategies, the type of strategy implemented did indeed matter. Although all four strategies provided teachers similar opportunities to discuss equity, some strategies were more effective than others in facilitating equity conversations.</ab>

        <ab>This article presents findings from an ongoing study focused on deconstructing pedagogical practices of successful mathematics teachers in classrooms with high populations of traditionally underserved students. Using grounded theory, the manuscript reports on general themes and specific practices of culturally responsive mathematics teaching (CRMT) that have been 'unearthed' from data collected over several years in three diverse mathematics classrooms. The findings indicate that, regardless of cultural setting, relationships and trust are central to CRMT, while communication patterns and various forms of knowledge mediate these relationships. Ultimately, CRMT provides student access, which is mediated by culture and identity, to complex mathematical ideas. Common concrete practices, such as warm demander pedagogy and reflection, are discussed. These results speak to the complexity of the culturally responsive mathematics classroom and provide suggestions to educators, administrators, and teacher educators who aim to become more culturally responsive.</ab>

        <ab>Background/Context: Education scholars have examined how state policy and informal practice can widen or reproduce racial and gender inequalities in graduate education. Just one empirical study, which focused on psychology programs, has identified organizational practice that supports recruitment and retention of graduate students of color. Focus of Study: To identify organizational conditions and specific activities that support diversity in STEM graduate programs, the authors conducted a yearlong case study of a physics program that, for the last decade, has trained about 10% of the Black Ph.D.s in physics, nationally. They identified and described concrete efforts to enhance access and inclusion, and sought to understand how this program distinguished itself from a traditional physics department. Participants: Study participants consisted of 16 faculty, administrators, administrative staff, and students affiliated with the Applied Physics program at the University of Michigan. Research Design: Data for this qualitative case study was collected through eighteen interviews, two student focus groups, observations of everyday life and special events in the program, and a large amount of documentary data. Guided by the constant comparative method, the analysis assessed convergence and divergence across types of data and across faculty, administrator, staff, and student perspectives. Major findings represent four areas of consensus across participant roles. Findings/Results: Four themes explain how Applied Physics has increased access to and inclusion in a field known for its inequality. The program institutionalized a flexible, interdisciplinary intellectual paradigm; they reconceputalized their vision of the ideal student and reformed admissions accordingly; they empowered administrative staff to serve as cultural translators across racial and faculty-student boundaries; and they worked to create a family-like climate that gave them a competitive advantage over other physics programs. Conclusions/Recommendations: We interpret the findings from the perspective of Charles Tilly's boundary change mechanisms, and conclude that the common thread among the four themes was the program's willingness to erase, relocate, and/or deactivate boundaries that had implicitly created barriers to access and inclusion for underrepresented students. The paper recommends specific steps that graduate programs can take to analyze the symbolic boundaries operating in their own programs, and invites scholars to utilize the boundaries perspective in future research on educational inequality.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, we explore how a school in Aotearoa [New Zealand] infuses the iden-tity of Indigenous students into the school-based curriculum through the promotion of their language and culture in mathematics lessons. Bernstein's pedagogic device illustrates how teachers' practices were influenced by being able to think the "unthinkable." This came from the contestation that arose when competing bodies of knowledge had to be integrated both at the school level and at the classroom level. For equity to be achieved regarding students' mathematics learning, parents' and the community's aspirations for students' education need to be infused into debates about the knowledge that teachers are expected to include in their teaching. This enables the local context to make a positive contribution to students' learning. It also implies that programs for improvement should not be imposed on schools unless there are opportunities for them to be adapted to the needs of individual schools.</ab>

        <ab>What happens when neoliberalism as a structural and structuring force is taken up within institutions of higher education, and works upon academics in higher education individually? Employing a critical authoethnographic approach, this paper explores the way technologies of research performance management, specifically, work to produce academics (and academic managers) as particular kinds of neoliberal subject. The struggle to make oneself visible is seen to occur under the gaze of academic normativity â the norms of academic practice that include both locally negotiated practices and the performative demands of auditing and metrics that characterise the neoliberal university. The paper indicates how the dual process of being worked upon and working upon ourselves can produce personally harmful effects. The result is a process of systemic violence. This paper invites higher education workers and policy-makers to think higher education otherwise and to reconsider our personal and collective complicity in the processes shaping higher education.</ab>

        <ab>This article examines teacher preparation and teacher change in engineering and computer science education. We examined culturally responsive teaching self-efficacy (CRTSE), culturally responsive teaching outcome expectancy (CRTOE) beliefs, and attitudes toward computational thinking (CT) as teachers participated in one of three treatment groups: robotics only, game design only, or blended robotics/game design. Descriptive data revealed that CRTSE gain scores were higher in the robotics only and blended contexts than in the game design only context. However, CRTOE beliefs were consistent across all treatment groups. In regard to CT attitudes, teachersâ gain scores were higher in the game design only and blended contexts than in the robotics only context. In addition, there were differences by treatment group related to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) practices, while cultural artifacts were evident in each learning environment. The results of this study reveal some variability by treatment type and inform future research on equitable practices in engineering and computer science education.</ab>

        <ab>This study explores ways to support girls of color in forming their senses of selves in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) during the middle school years. Guided by social practice theory, we analyzed a large data set of survey responses (nâ=â1,821) collected at five middle schools in lowâincome communities across four states in the United States. Analyses focus on the extent to which key constructs that inform girls' development of senses of self and relations among those indicators of STEM identities varied by their race/ethnicity. Though the means of indicators sometimes varied across racial/ethnic groups, multigroup structural equation modeling analyses indicate no significant racial/ethnic differences in the relations of STEM identities, suggesting that similar supports would be equally effective for all girls during the middle school years. Girls' selfâperception in relation to science was the strongest predictor of their identification with STEMârelated careers, and this selfâperception was positively and distinctively associated with their experiences with science at home, outside of school, and in school science classes. This study argues for strategically expanding girls' experiences with science across multiple settings during middle school in a way that increases their positive selfâperception in and with STEM.</ab>

        <ab>When actualised in a concrete school, the official discourse of inclusion and equity often encounters a series of obstacles that research strives to identify and address under the imperative to eliminate them. Through the exploration of classroom episodes, teacher interviews and field notes from a German secondary school, we take failure not as a correctable obstacle but as a symptom of the ideology at work in current educational practices. Symptoms, as Å½iÅ¾ek (after Lacan) suggested, cannot be eliminated but always (re)emerge since they concern the impossibility of official discourses actualising themselves. We thus argue for a research agenda that learns from failure instead of research concerned with the possible successes that might prospectively be brought into existence, if just the ârightâ theory was applied âcorrectlyâ.</ab>

        <ab>This study used the Teaching for Social Justice Observation Scale (TSJOS) of the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol-Plus (RTOP+) to examine the extent to which twenty-two novice elementary teachers implemented practices related to teaching for social justice in their mathematics instruction. In addition, this study sought to examine the extent to which practices related to teaching for social justice were related to pupil learning outcomes, as measured by end-of-unit district-based assessments. We found that, on average, the participants in this study implemented a moderate amount of teaching practices related to teaching for social justice. Furthermore, after correlating the teaching practices with pupil outcomes, we found a significant, positive relationship between teaching for social justice and pupil outcomes (r = 0.44, p&lt;0.05). We discuss implications of these findings and recommend further use of the TSJOS.</ab>

        <ab>In this article the authors discuss the process of designing a digital experience to support prospective teachers to learn to enact an equity-based complex practice of mathematics teaching, namely to notice students' mathematical strengths rather than notice gaps and deficits in their thinking. LessonSketch is a web-based platform purposefully designed to support the work of teacher educators. After theorizing how approximations of practice provide prospective teachers with ways and means for leveraging complex, equity-based pedagogical practices, the authors describe how they used LessonSketch to design a flexible digital learning experience for prospective teachers in mathematics methods courses. The authors reflect on the design choices they made, the challenges they faced, and the educational potential of their LessonSketch experience. They conclude by sharing design considerations and challenges that guided their work together and that could guide other mathematics teacher educators to support prospective teachers' learning of complex pedagogical practices.</ab>

        <ab>This study examined how Black students responded to the utilization of culturally responsive stories in their mathematics class. All students in the two classes participated in mathematics lessons that began with an African American story (culturally responsive to this population), followed by mathematical discussion and concluded with solving problems that correlated to the story. The researcher observed and recorded responses by students during each part of these lessons with protocols. Students independently reflected weekly by answering five questions to share their perspective on the African American stories. The teacher reflected on each lesson as well, describing thoughts on how these students responded to the story in each lesson. This paper examines the analyzed data from the target audience: Black students. Results revealed that Black students responded to the use of African American stories with high self-rated levels of engagement and enjoyment and that the stories helped them think about mathematics to varying degrees. Since students who are engaged and are thinking about mathematics are more likely to achieve mathematical understanding, the researcher concludes that this strategy should continue to be tested in diverse classrooms with an emphasis on student reflection to determine if the outcomes are transferable and generalizable.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Multimodal literacies have been incorporated as social learning practices in content areas, but research regarding multimodality within secondary mathematics instruction has often lacked the sociocultural lens. The author describes practitioner action research in the form of a case study (with one focal participant) from a public high school. The author explored the use of multimodal literacies through geometry studentsâ projects, work samples, classroom videos, and interviews. Students created and presented arguments (through PowerPoint, Word, videos, and storybooks) on court cases in efforts to relate proving and justifying in geometry to evidence and claims in court. Findings reveal ways that multimodal literacies served as a vehicle for students to engage with their social context of learning in a mathematics classroom, demonstrating that sociocultural approaches to multimodal literacies can apprentice students into disciplinary literacy practices of mathematics. Moreover, these sociocultural perspectives toward multimodal literacies pose possible instructional applications in multiple content areas.</ab>

        <ab>This multi-methods, descriptive case study examines attitudes and practices of classroom-based iPad use. The site is one inner-city, urban, publicly funded school, focused on two iPad-infused classrooms (Grade 2/3 and Grade 4/5). Data were collected from 5 educators and 35 students to investigate two research questions: How are iPads being utilized in student instruction? How do educators and students perceive the value of using iPads in the classroom? For this study, we analyzed the transcript of a focus group with five educators, data from 10 days of structured student observations, and the results from 35 student questionnaires. Five themes emerged from the focus group; the strongest related to pedagogical practices. Data related to student perceptions indicated a positive attitude toward iPads. They enjoyed iPad use, were concerned about equity issues, had high self-ratings about related skills, felt they used it most often in Mathematics, and indicated various preferred applications. Overall, iPads were used in 31.7% of observed instructional time, 94.7% of which was facilitated by classroom teachers. Of this iPadbased instructional time, 72.5% was for individualized teaching, typically in language and/or mathematics instruction. Our analysis culminates in recommendations for school leadership such as teaching prerequisite skills and providing ongoing technological supports. The introduction of user-friendly, portable digital technology such as tablet devices has changed education (Churchill &amp; Wang, 2014): "Twenty-first-century technologies are also about the portability of mobile digital devices which now have the potential to allow any-time access" (Male &amp; Burden, 2014, p. 424). Apple iPad's popularity has soared in schools, likely due to elements such available educational applications (apps), built-in accessibility features with user-friendliness for a diverse population, and strong levels of support (Draper RodrÃ­guez, StrnadovÃ¡, &amp; Cumming, 2014). Despite widespread adoption of iPads, there has been limited research to support their use in education; rather, many questions (e.g., What barriers arise?) are just beginning to be addressed.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: With social justice becoming a hallmark of educational practice, teachers are encouraged to weave social justice into teaching. We used curricular materials to help strengthen teacher-candidates abilities to incorporate social justice into mathematics while helping expand their understanding of social justice practices and mathematics teaching. Teacher-candidates were asked to present mathematics lessons that incorporated social justice. Findings reveal a lack of firm understanding of both mathematics and social justice practices that impedes their ability to incorporate social justice into mathematics curriculum. Suggestions for applied research about social justice in mathematics education is discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Informal STEM education institutions seek to engage broader cross sections of their communities to address inequities in STEM participation and remain relevant in a multicultural society. In this chapter, we advance the role that evaluation can play in helping the field adopt more inclusive practices and achieve greater equity than at present through evaluation that addresses sociopolitical contexts and reflects the perspectives and values of nonâdominant communities. To do this for specific projects, we argue that evaluation should privilege the voices and lived experiences of nonâdominant communities, engage communities in identifying desired outcomes, and ensure multicultural validity of instruments, measures, and inferences. At the fieldâwide level, we urge evaluators to examine conceptualizations of "broadening participation in STEM," evaluate communityâbased partnerships, and address replication and scaling. Ultimately, these actions can lead to greater equity in evaluation and in informal STEM education.</ab>

        <ab>The relationships between mathematics, mathematics education and issues such as social justice and equity have been addressed by the sociopolitical tradition in mathematics education. Others have introduced explicit discussion of ethics, advocating for its centrality. However, this is an area that is still under developed. There is a need for an ethics of mathematics education that can inform moment to moment choices to address a wide range of ethical situations. I argue that mathematics educators make ethical choices which are necessarily ambiguous and complex. This is illustrated with examples from practice. The concept of ethical dimension is introduced as a heuristic to consider the awareness of different forms of relationship and arenas of action. A framework is proposed and discussed of four important dimensions: the relationship with others, the societal and cultural, the ecological and the relationship with self. Attending to the different ethical dimensions supports the development of a plural relational ethics. Navigating ethical complexity requires embracing diverse and changing commitments. An ethics that takes account of these different dimensions supports an ethical praxis that is based on principles of flexibility and a dialogical relationship to the world and practice.</ab>

        <ab>Senior pre-university education (SPE) students experience difficulties applying mathematics to physics. This paper reports the outcome of an online explorative quantitative study of teachers' belief systems about improving transfer of algebraic skills from mathematics into physics, conducted among 503 mathematics and physics teachers working in SPE. We used a questionnaire with 16 beliefs about improving transfer, and asked teachers to select a top 5 and distribute 50 points among them. We used agglomerative hierarchical clustering to cluster qualified SPE teachers with more than 10 years of teaching experience. We found 3 large clusters, each containing naÃ¯ve and desirable beliefs about transfer. These clusters turned out to be rather coherent sets of beliefs. Hence, these clusters can be interpreted as belief systems, to a certain extent justifying Ernest's [(1991). The philosophy of mathematics education. London: Falmer.] idea to cluster teachers based on their belief systems. We found relations between our groups and those of Ernest. Since naÃ¯ve beliefs turn out to be weak in each cluster, science teacher educators can help science teachers to change their harmful naÃ¯ve beliefs, into desirable transfer enhancing beliefs. Furthermore, we discuss some implications of our results for science teacher educators, curricula, teachers and textbooks.</ab>

        <ab>To learn mathematical practices, students need opportunities to engage in them. But simply providing such opportunities may not be sufficient to support all students. Simultaneously, explicitly teaching mathematical practices could be problematic if instruction becomes prescriptive. This study investigated how teachers might make mathematical practices explicit in classroom discourse. Analyses of 26 discussions from 3 mathematics classes revealed that teachers made mathematical practices explicit primarily after students had participated in them. I present a framew'ork of 8 types of teacher moves that made mathematical practices explicit and argue that they did so without turning practices into prescriptions or reducing students' opportunities to engage in them. This suggests a need to expand conceptions of explicitness to promote access to mathematical practices.</ab>

        <ab>Although the Common Core State Standards call on parents to support professional educators' efforts for improving student academic achievement, we have yet to examine how to best support parents in achieving this goal. The present study addresses this need by examining a five-month mathematics intervention which aimed to increase awareness of the eight Common Core State Standards for the Mathematical Practices (CCSS-MP) in a culturally, linguistically, and generationally diverse group of parents. The intervention consisted of five mathematics workshops designed as part of a multilayered collaboration between a community organization and a teacher educator. One Mexican American and two African American parent--child dyads (n = 3) were video recorded solving "rich" mathematics tasks before and after the intervention. Video recordings were coded using a coding scheme developed from the CCSS-MP. Results indicated parent--child dyads engaged in more and a greater variety of the CCSS-MP after the intervention. Also, the ratio of parent to child talk related to the eight mathematical practices decreased. The results suggest that parents' mathematics assistance practices changed in such a way that allowed for their children to enact more of the CCSS-MP, which means that children were engaged more deeply in the doing of mathematics at the second time period. Implications for parent education curriculum designers are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the ways prospective elementary teachers (PSTs) made connections to childrenâs mathematical thinking and childrenâs community funds of knowledge in mathematics lesson plans. We analyzed the work of 70 PSTs from across three university sites associated with an instructional module for elementary mathematics methods courses that asks PSTs to visit community settings and develop problem solving mathematics lessons that connect to mathematical practices in these settings (Community Mathematics Exploration Module). Using analytic induction, we identified three distinct levels of connections to childrenâs mathematical thinking and their community funds of knowledge evidenced in PSTsâ work (emergent, transitional, and meaningful). Findings describe how these connections reflected different points on a learning trajectory. This study has implications for understanding how PSTs begin to connect to childrenâs mathematical funds of knowledge in their teaching, a practice shown to be effective for teaching diverse groups of children.</ab>

        <ab>Often mathematical instruction for students with disabilities, especially those with learning disabilities, includes an overabundance of instruction on mathematical computation and does not include high-quality instruction on mathematical reasoning and problem solving. In fact, it is a common misconception that students with learning disabilities are not strong problem solvers in general. This article highlights the inherent problem solving strengths that students with learning disabilities possess; how they use those skills to address everyday barriers and challenges, and how teachers can relate these skills to academic mathematical instruction. Additionally, practical classroom examples, suggested teaching strategies, and questions for further examinations are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Background/Context: In this article we explore equity issues related to school district decisionmaking about students' opportunities to learn algebra. We chose algebra because of the important role it plays in the U.S. as a gatekeeper to future academic success. Current research has not yet explored issues of equity in district-level decision-making. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: We examine the extent to which district decision-makers for mathematics attend to aspects of equity when they make decisions about resources related to the teaching and learning of algebra. The research questions guiding this study were: How do district decision-makers for mathematics report considering issues of equity when making decisions about students' opportunities to learn Algebra I? How do district characteristics, particularly students' racial and ethnic diversity, affect the extent of equity considerations by mathematics decision-makers? Research Design: We surveyed a national probability sample of 993 district decision-makers for mathematics about criteria that they consider when they select and distribute resources and structure learning opportunities in algebra for students and teachers in their districts. These survey items were our attempt to identify district-level practices in relationship to an equity framework. In this study, we examine national patterns in criteria for decision-making about algebra resources and examine the relation of these criteria to district features using a structural equation model. Findings: Our findings suggest that fewer decision-makers considered equity-related criteria in their decision-making about algebra, while many tended to endorse equality-related items addressing considerations for all students, such as giving all students the same resources or attending to preparation for standardized testing. The vast majority of decision-makers reported considering real life contexts for algebra when making decisions about professional development (PD) and curriculum, while fewer considered the students' culture or culturally relevant teaching. Decision-makers in only about half of the districts reported considering structural aspects, such as tracking. Modeling of the survey responses indicates that decisionmakers in the most racially or ethnically and linguistically diverse districts have the greatest tendency to consider equity criteria in structuring students' opportunities to learn algebra. Conclusions/Recommendations: The extent to which district decision-makers for mathematics attend to aspects of equity is noteworthy because their decisions inform the selection and distribution of educational resources for learning algebra across districts. These findings raise important concerns with respect to how district decision-making mobilizes and shapes the resources available to teachers and students. Recommendations include supporting district decision-makers in a) expanding their conceptions of real life contexts to include students' culture, b) considering different framings of the problem of participation gaps, c) reconsidering ability grouping and understanding the negative consequences of tracking, and d) carefully examining the kinds of stated and unarticulated rules, rewards, and sanctions that get put into place to uncover how inequitable practices get perpetuated.</ab>

        <ab>This paper explores the experiences of 14 early years educators who participated in a continuing professional development (CPD) programme coordinated by two of the paperâs authors. The programme was part of a three-year research project, which aimed at introducing early childhood educators to an inquiry-based approach to mathematics and science education and involved participants as teacher-researchers and curriculum-makers in cycles of action research. From this CPD experience, teachers appeared to reconceptualize traditional teacher and researcher ârolesâ in more fluid and equitable ways, leading us to explore characteristics of the programme conducive to this shift. The main data source comprised teacher interviews, supplemented by video-recordings of group meetings, classroom enactment of activities and the facilitatorsâ field notes. Findings suggest that the shift was encouraged by the gradual formation of a community of practice; a reconceptualization of the âpracticalâ; and the epistemology-oriented approach adopted in mathematics and science education. The discussion highlights the implications of these findings for early years educatorsâ professional development, and the problems of the âtheoryâpracticeâ divide in such development. Furthermore, the discussion stresses the importance of the socio-cultural context in which such projects take place, particularly as these often draw heavily upon international literature.</ab>

        <ab>In this research, the authors raised the issue that prior studies had failed to address the nested structure of data in examining the construct validity of an instrument measuring students' behavioral and emotional participation in academic activities in the classroom. To address this question, the authors illustrated the utility of the multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA) approach to reexamine the construct validity of this instrument. The sample consisted of 2,041 students in 5th grade from 67 classes in Hong Kong. First, the results justified the requirement of MCFA and indicated that the 4-factor model tested with MCFA provided better fit to the data than that tested with a single-level confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Second, the study also provided adequate support for a multilevel second-order two-factor model that distinguished engagement from disaffection. Third, the factor structure was invariant across the student level and the classroom level for both the 4-factor model and the second-order two-factor model. Fourth, the results highlighted the presence of ambiguity in differentiating between the dimensions at the classroom level and supported the unidimensionality of the classroom-level construct. Fifth, student engagement was significantly and positively correlated with mathematics test scores, teachers' classroom-management practices, teacher support, and student order in the classroom. Finally, the authors discuss the implications of the study and its limitations and offer suggestions for model selection and explorations for future research.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, the authors report on a study that contributes to a growing body of literature that considers professional development (PD) focused on mathematics and equity. The authors examined how lived experiences provide a foundation for the ways teachers take up equity in their mathematics teaching practice. The constructs of praxis and figured worlds are used to frame the study. In particular, teachersâ identities in the figured worlds of standards-based mathematics, multicultural education, and equitable mathematics pedagogy were explored with a focus on how they contributed to where the teachers located praxis for equity in mathematics. The teachersâ lived experiences and their participation in the PD were analyzed with an eye toward teachersâ evolving identities and how they contribute to where teachers located praxis.</ab>

        <ab>This article explores how issues of power and identity play out in mathematical practices and offers a perspective on how we might better understand the sociopo-litical nature of teaching and learning mathematics. We present data from studies of mathematics teaching and learning in out-of-school settings, offering a sociocultural, then a sociopolitical analysis (attending to race, identity, and power), noting the value of the latter. In doing so, we develop a set of theoretical tools that move us from the sociocultural to the sociopolitical in studies of mathematics teaching and learning.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: This article shares the case of a studentâdrivenâ¯investigationâ¯intoâ¯social issues from an eighthâgrade civics class at an American school in Mexico. Through vignettes about the teaching and learning process, the author argues that a focus on studentsâ inquiry into their social contexts rather than on specific social justice content is a key practice when teaching for critical democratic literacy, especially when teachers and students come from different social contexts. This article offers a concrete example of how foregrounding studentsâ critical questions can help move students toward social justiceâoriented citizenship.</ab>

        <ab>This article describes teachers' collective work aimed at learning to teach mathematics for social justice. A situated, sociocultural perspective of learning guides this examina-tion of teachers' negotiation of mathematical goals and social justice goals as they developed, implemented, and revised lessons for social justice. Teacher interviews, discussions, lessons, and written reflections were analyzed using grounded theory methodology, and teachers' conversations were examined concerning the relationship between mathematical goals and social justice goals. Analysis revealed that early tensions arose around balancing these goals, that teachers focused more attention on the social justice component, and that the instantiation of these goals in practice proved difficult. Variables that afford or constrain teachers' roles as social justice educators are discussed, and implications for teacher professional development are suggested.</ab>

        <ab>Employing metasynthesis as a method, this study examined 52 empirical articles on culturally relevant and responsive science education in K-12 settings to determine the nature and scope of complementarity between culturally responsive and inquiry-based science practices (i.e., science and engineering practices identified in the National Research Council's Framework for K-12 Science Education). The findings from this study indicate several areas of complementarity. Most often, the inquiry-based practices Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information, Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions, and Developing and Using Models were used to advance culturally responsive instruction and assessment. The use and development of models, in particular, allowed students to explore scientific concepts through families' funds of knowledge and explain content from Western science and Indigenous Knowledge perspectives. Moreover, students frequently Analyzed and Interpreted Data when interrogating science content in sociopolitical consciousness-raising experiences, such as identifying pollution and asthma incidences in an urban area according to neighborhood location. Specific inquiry-based practices were underutilized when advancing culturally responsive science instruction, though. For example, Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking and Engaging in Argument from Evidence were infrequently encountered. However, culturally responsive engineering-related practices were most often connected with these, and thus, represent potential areas for future complementarity, particularly as the United States embraces the Next Generation Science Standards. In considering innovative directions for advancing equitable science education, several possibilities are discussed in light of the findings of this study.Â© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        <ab>In this qualitative case study, the researchers explored 3 8th grade teachers' formative assessment practices as it occurred during their mathematics instruction at socioeconomic status (SES)-different schools in Taiwan. Instructionally embedded formative assessment we refer to as discourse-based assessment practice (DAP). In Taiwan, there is a large mathematics achievement gap among high SES and low SES and minority students in 8th grade. Addressing this issue at the level of classroom practice, we attempt to document teachers' DAP using a parsimonious, but practical framework for analyzing classroom discourse in 23 lessons. For the purpose of this study, 3 lessons for each teacher are represented. The extended sequence (Mehan, ) was the primary unit of analysis, to which we applied our framework for illuminating and differentiating the teachers' press for student understanding through questions and feedback. The analysis of the teacher's instruction at the high SES indicated that it was more formative than the others, pressing for mathematical understanding. The 2 teachers at the low SES schools pressed for rote understanding, though there were qualitative differences between them. The findings raise more questions and implications for research and education policy. In Taiwan where there is scant research on classroom practices, DAP as an instructional improvement may be a starting point for educational improvement for all its students.</ab>

This qualitative study reports the results of eight successful elementary mathematics teachers' knowledge of equity pedagogy, specifically their knowledge of culturally relevant pedagogy, cultural competence, and critical consciousness. Teachers' knowledge of equity pedagogy was examined using interview data. The results of this study revealed that successful mathematics teachers of African American students have knowledge of equity pedagogy. Implications for teacher preparation and professional development programs are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Women's under-representation in high-paying jobs in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) mirrors their earlier choices of matriculation electives: male students favour physics, information technology and advanced mathematics; female students favour life sciences. âPipelineâ theories attribute these patterns to a male advantage in mathematics, but our longitudinal analysis, using administrative data on a full cohort of students in Victoria, Australia, shows that these patterns remain intact after conditioning on prior achievement. Female students require stronger prior signals of mathematical ability to choose male-dominated subjects, and when choosing these subjects earn higher average scores than males, suggesting a possible loss of efficiency. Previous research has shown that socio-economic disadvantage adversely affects boys more than girls, and indeed we find less of a male advantage in physics and advanced mathematics among socially disadvantaged students. We find that students with a language background other than English choose STEM fields with greater frequency than other students, reflecting their comparative advantage, while exhibiting more markedly gendered subject choices, indicating a role for cultural factors. Finally, we find significantly less gender streaming in STEM subjects among female students in all-girl schools than in co-educational schools, but no such difference for male students.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, we explore a sociological approach to mathematics education and offer a theoretical lens through which we can come to understand mathematics education as part of a wider set of social practices. Many studies of children's experiences in school show that a child's academic success is a product of many factors, some of which are beyond the control and, sometimes, the knowledge of the classroom teacher. We draw on the sociological ideas of Pierre Bourdieu to frame our analysis of the environment in which the pupils learn and the ways in which the practices help to create parallel worlds which are structured quite differently inside and outside the classroom. Specifically, we use Bourdieu's notions of habitus, field and capital. Using two cases, we highlight the subtle and coercive ways in which the practices of the field of mathematics education allow greater or lesser access to the hegemonic knowledge known as school mathematics depending on the cultural backgrounds and dispositions of the learners. We examine the children's mathematical learning trajectories and reflect on how what they achieve in the future will, in all likelihood, be shaped by their social background and how compatible this is with the current educational climate.</ab>

        <ab>This study draws on the concept of cultural capital to determine whether the cultural capital of students is related to their perceptions of classroom interactions, specifically teacherâstudent feedback practices. The analysis of new data in 'Feedback and Cultural Capital,' a Danish survey of feedback practices among 14-year-old and 15-year-old students (N = 1101), showed a positive and practically linear relationship between the cultural capital of the students and the amount of feedback they perceived in lower secondary mathematics classrooms. Drawing on Bourdieu's theory of cultural reproduction in education, I argue that this inequality stems from either or both of two mechanisms: differences in treatment by teachers and/or differences in the perceptions of students. I link both mechanisms to the cultural capital of the students. Furthermore, the results indicate that the relationship was stronger for boys than for girls. The implications of the findings for practice and policy are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Studies in mathematics education often point to the necessity for students to engage in more cognitively demanding activities than just solving tasks by applying given solution methods. Previous studies have shown that students that engage in creative mathematically founded reasoning to construct a solution method, perform significantly better in follow up tests than students that are given a solution method and engage in algorithmic reasoning. However, teachers and textbooks, at least occasionally, provide explanations together with an algorithmic method, and this could possibly be more efficient than creative reasoning. In this study, three matched groups practiced with either creative, algorithmic, or explained algorithmic tasks. The main finding was that students that practiced with creative tasks did, outperform the students that practiced with explained algorithmic tasks in a post-test, despite a much lower practice score. The two groups that got a solution method presented, performed similarly in both practice and post-test, even though one group got an explanation to the given solution method. Additionally, there were some differences between the groups in which variables predicted the post-test score.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, I propose an index, called the Social Index of Educational Effectiveness (SIEE), which allows the establishment of an objective criterion to define the school's profile concerning the promotion of educational equity. It makes it possible to differentiate schools with an "inclusionary profile," (SIEE&gt;0), from those with an "exclusionary profile," (SIEE&lt;0), depending on whether or not the school fosters educational inclusion, and therefore promoting social equity. I have analyzed 272 schools (N=11,732 students) of five urban contexts in Brazil and found behaviors markedly different for the two learning subjects; reading and mathematics, the mean SIEE yielding positive and negative values, respectively. I argue that the SIEE concept is relevant for the analysis of educational effectiveness and should be considered as such by educational researchers and policymakers.</ab>

        <ab>This study examined trainee teachers' mathematical knowledge in teaching (MKiT) over their final year in a US Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programme. This paper reports on an exploratory methodological approach taken to use the Knowledge Quartet to quantify MKiT through the development of a new protocol to code trainees' teaching of mathematics lessons. This approach extends Rowland's et al. work on the Knowledge Quartet (KQ). Justification for using the KQ to quantify MKiT, and the potential benefits such an attempt might provide those involved with ITE, are discussed. It is suggested that quantified MKiT data based on the Knowledge Quartet can be used to consider MKiT development in novice teachers in order to inform ITE programmes and form new theoretical loops between theory and practice in teacher education.</ab>

        <ab>The writer examines the intersection of race, class, and language issues with the effective teaching and learning of mathematics.  Particular attention is paid to the practices and development of teachers with the aim of successfully advancing Latina/os, African Americans, and other subordinate populations in mathematics while addressing social justice.  Three tensions are highlighted that can promote the process of privileging equity over equality, education over schooling, and power/identity over mere access and achievement.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose o f this article is to present the results of a study that examined the influence o f a multi-stage, equity-focused professional development program on the beliefs and understandings about issues of equity and classroom practices among 28 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) community college faculty members. The authors describe how the beliefs and understandings of the faculty members shifted after each stage of the program. They found that, only after implementing professional development in their classroom practices, there was a statistically significant shift in faculty members' understanding of seven of the nine constructs measured by the survey. The study reveals the need for community college faculty to implement research-informed professional development in the classroom.</ab>

        <ab>Black males, as one non-dominant population, remain underrepresented and less successful in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Researchers focused on non-dominant populations are advised against generalizations and to examine cultural intersections (i.e. race, ethnicity, gender, and more) and also to explore cases of success, in addition to cases of under-achievement and underrepresentation. This study has focused on one African American male, Randy, who expressed high-achieving STEM career goals in computer science and engineering. Furthermore, recognizing that culture and identity development underlie STEM engagement and persistence, this long-term case study focused on how Randy developed a STEM identity during the course of the study and the implications of that process for his STEM career exploration. Ãtienne Wengerâs (1999) communities-of-practice (CoP) was employed as a theoretical framework and, in doing so, (1) the informal STEM program in which Randy participated was characterized as a STEM-for-social-justice CoP and (2) Randy participated in ways that consistently utilized an âeconomicsâ lens from beyond the boundaries of the CoP. In doing so, Randy functioned as a broker within the CoP and developed a non-traditional STEM identity-in-practice which integrated STEM, âeconomicsâ, and community engagement. Randyâs STEM identity-in-practice is discussed in terms of the contextual factors that support scientific identity development (Hazari et al. in J Res Sci Teach 47:978-1003, 2010), the importance of recognizing and supporting the development of holistic and non-traditional STEM identities, especially for diverse populations in STEM, and the implications of this new understanding of Randyâs STEM identity for his long-term STEM career exploration.</ab>

        <ab>Despite widespread discourse about the need for teachers to utilize education research, little is known about how teachers learn to engage in this practice. How do preservice teachers understand the use of research to inform their teaching? Set within the context of a mathematics methods course, this study provides a detailed analysis of the written research implementation plans of 29 preservice teachers. The data were analyzed using the principles of grounded theory, and four themes were developed regarding preservice teacher ability to understand research, create an implementation plan, modify the plan, and evaluate the plan. The findings problematize the complex process of research implementation and indicate microskills that teacher educators can address when preparing novices to engage in the process of research utilization.</ab>

        <ab>In October of 2017, I came across Alice Pawley's ([7]) guest editorial titled "Shifting the "Default": The Case for Making Diversity the Expected Condition for Engineering Education and Making Whiteness and Maleness Visible." Pawley articulated an argument that I had been struggling to make within my own field of aviation studies: Inclusive practice needed to extend beyond student programming and into the research and everyday praxis of engineering educators. If we want engineering education as a field to be innovative in how it researches and engages with the student experience, then it cannot just shift the default for education research; it must reconsider both its methodological practices and pedagogies so that they "value everyone's presence".</ab>

        <ab>In this manuscript, we use the construct of critical epistemologies of place to frame our exploration of how to support engineering design among youth who have historically been marginalized from the domain, and its implications for educational settings. We present an inâdepth longitudinal case study of one 12âyearâold African American boy to raise questions of what it means for this youth to engage in engineering design in collaboration with the people around in himâexperts and knowledgeable others in his community space and how this engagement supports his work in science and engineering. This study suggests that engaging engineering design through a critical epistemology of place involves an iterative and generative process of layering community wisdom and knowledge onto STEM toward (a) how epistemologies of placeâand their layersâchallenge dominant master narratives, (b) reimagining practices in place, and (c) transforming the dangerous territory of STEM. Our study expands upon current understandings of supporting youth in engaging engineering through highlighting the vital role of sociohistorically constructed understandings of STEM and community in determining when, how, and why engineering takes place.</ab>

        <ab>The results of international large-scale assessments have revealed the emergence of gender disparities in attitudes to mathematics, with girls generally demonstrating lower levels of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics than boys. Given that attitudes to mathematics are key determinants of future STEM participation, collaborative cognitive-activation teaching strategies, which harmonise with the core tenets of feminist mathematical pedagogy, are proposed as a possible approach to improving girlsâ relationships with mathematics. The results of a small-scale cross-national case study that incorporated this approach through a six week intervention are reported. The findings show a significant increase in girlsâ enjoyment of mathematics but there was no significant change in boysâ attitudes. Potential implications for mathematics education policy and practice are elucidated.</ab>

A study examined ten Latino parents' attitudes toward a mathematics pedagogy and curriculum for social justice.  Results revealed several reasons why these Latino parents supported a social justice mathematics curriculum, including their desire to teach children to stand up for and defend their rights; their belief that mathematics was a central part of life; and their belief that mathematics should prepare students for life.  Other results and implications of the study are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>African American students have been systematically discouraged from taking advanced courses in science and math. In addition, low Advanced Placement (AP) exam passing rates among African American students raise further concerns regarding whether accessibility alone adequately addresses the issue of equity. However, little research has been conducted to understand African American students' learning experiences in AP science courses. The purpose of this research is twofold: (a) to gain deeper understandings of the behaviors and attitudes that African American students employ in their AP science courses, especially how they align their personal motives and goals with meaningful practices within the AP learning context, and (b) to offer an opportunity for science educators to reâconceptualize AP science learning environment from an CulturalâHistorical Activity Theory (CHAT) perspective. The participants were four African American students enrolled in two AP courses: biology and environmental science. The primary data source was from semistructured interviews. Three major themes were identified: (a) exchange value dominating intrinsic value, (b) community support overcoming an oppositional cultural, and (c) metacognitive strategies disconnecting from conceptual understanding.</ab>

        <ab>We investigated how community ethnography as a pedagogy approach to STEM-rich making supported youth makers from two low-income urban communities engaged in sustained STEM-rich making towards making a difference in their communities. Data is drawn from two-year long ethnographic data across two community-based, youth making programs. We highlight two cases. Case # 1 focuses on one African American girl's making endeavors across one school year. Case # 2 looks at how two youth engaged in critical sense-making with regards to the currently available how-to making resources they could locate online. We discuss how these pedagogical moves supported the youth in making towards a more just future in ways that addressed intersecting scales of injustice.</ab>

        <ab>In considering 'good teaching' in mathematics, scholars usually refer to teacher knowledge and instructional practices that promote understanding. However, researchers have found that these two elements of instruction are often not as prevalent in urban contexts, a space where high percentages of students of color and the poor are educated. Additionally, recent work calls for understanding other classroom mechanisms that impact the mathematics learning of students of color. Using video, field notes, and an interview, this research examines a case study of one urban classroom of Latino and African American students. Their teacher engages them in substantive mathematics and reform-minded pedagogical strategies, but a number of relational interactions raise issues of how these micro-interactions can mediate access to mathematics. The study found four dimensions in which relational interactions mediated access to mathematics: addressing behavior, framing mathematics ability, acknowledging student contributions, and attending to culture and language. The paper ends with raising questions for future research and calling for a broader framing of instruction that incorporates relational dimensions of the classroom.</ab>

        <ab>This article addresses an approach to design-based research informed by cultural historical activity theory and ecological approaches to inquiry in which historicity, prolepsis, remediation, diversity and equity, transformability, resilience, and sustainability are organizing design principles. Social design-based experiments seek to co-design learning ecologies in which learning is made equitable and consequential for youth from nondominant communities. In this article, we focus on the ways the design of El Pueblo MÃ¡gico, an after-school STEAM-oriented 5th Dimension program, involved saturating the environment with new tools and forms of assistance and privileged intergenerational learning to engage youth and their university amigxs in new technology-mediated practices. In particular, we examine how designing around the leading activity of play opened up opportunities for youth to engage in consequential forms of learning across El Pueblo MÃ¡gico and home practices, as well as how digital tools and practices traveled and mediated new learning for young learners.</ab>

        <ab>The maker movement has evoked interest for its role in breaking down barriers to STEM learning. However, few empirical studies document how youth are supported over time in STEM-rich making projects or their outcomes. This longitudinal critical ethnographic study traces the development of 41 youth maker projects in two community-centered making programs. Building a conceptual argument for an equity-oriented culture of making, the authors discuss the ways in which making with and in community opened opportunities for youth to project their communities' rich culture knowledge and wisdom onto their making while also troubling and negotiating the historicized injustices they experience. The authors also discuss how community engagement legitimized a practice of co-making, which supported equity-oriented goals and outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Central to ambitious teaching is a constellation of practices we have come to call "leveraging student thinking." In leveraging, teachers position students' understanding and reasoning as a central means to drive learning forward. While leveraging typically is described as a feature of mature practice, in this article we examine approximations of leveraging as enacted by elementary teachers who are just beginning their careers. In addition to providing an existence proof that novices can leverage when teaching elementary mathematics, the analysis surfaces and illustrates four pressure pointsâepistemic, academic, developmental, and managerialâthat can short-circuit the development of novices' efforts. Our framing of these pressure points both spotlights the complex dynamics at play, and establishes an agenda for supporting the development of this practice: learning to leverage student thinking is a challenging and long-term endeavor, rather than a routine easily acquired.</ab>

        <ab>This paper is centered on creating equitable opportunities for learners in mathematics education. Through observations of teacher practice, the paper seeks to theorize how teachers enact their dispositions toward mathematics instruction. These observed propensities, in relation to teachers' aims for students to 'take up their space' in and beyond the mathematics classroom, then inform a model of equitable mathematics instruction. Teachers' dispositions are considered in relation to Mason's discipline of noticing and Bourdieu's notion of the symbolic violence of dominant discourses.</ab>

        <ab>The implementation of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices &amp; Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010) has the potential to move forward key features of standards-based reforms in mathematics that have been promoted in the United States for more than 2 decades (e.g., National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1989,2000; National Science Foundation, 1996). We believe that this is an especially opportune time to purposely focus on improving the mathematics education of students who have historically been denied access to a high-quality and rigorous mathematics education in the United States, specifically low-income students and students of color (e.g., Kitchen, DePree, CeledÃ³n-Pattichis, &amp; Brinkerhoff, 2007; Leonard &amp; Martin, 2013). We discuss a challenge to realizing standards-based reforms in mathematics in the United States: computer-based interventions in mathematics classrooms.</ab>

        <ab>Some mathematics educators assert that P-12 students respond better to mathematics when it is taught for cultural relevance and social justice. Providing teachers with examples of how to use culturally relevant pedagogy and social justice pedagogy (SJP) is critical to enacting these strategies in mathematics classrooms. The results of this teacherâresearch study reveal that teacher candidates (TCs) had greater understanding about how to teach for social justice after taking a mathematics education course that used literature circles to learn about and understand SJP. Moreover, TCs successfully incorporated three social justice principles into microteaching episodes. The authors also found that TCsâ beliefs regarding teaching for social justice were malleable. However, additional studies are warranted to determine if activities like the ones described in this study actually lead to changes in classroom practice.</ab>

        <ab>MATHEMATICS IS COMMONLY CITED in Australian and international literature as an integral component of quality early childhood education and care (ECEC) programs. This article presents a rights-based argument for early childhood educators to integrate mathematical concepts into daily ECEC practice. There is a lack of educator confidence in the ECEC sector regarding teaching mathematics concepts to preschool-aged children. At the same time, many children from low socioeconomic status backgrounds underperform in mathematics and girls are under-represented in so-called STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in later schooling. Providing opportunities for young children to participate in mathematical thinking in their daily educational programs provides opportunities for children to develop competencies that will equip them to be active citizens, now and in the future. This is an important means of ensuring equitable learning outcomes for all children.</ab>

        <ab>This study demonstrates the importance of a critical lens on disability in mathematics educational research. This ethnographic and interview study investigated how ability and disability were constructed over 1 year in a middle school mathematics classroom. Children participated in two kinds of mathematical pedagogy that positioned children differently: procedural and discussion-based. These practices shifted over time, as the teacher increasingly focused on memorization of procedures to prepare for state testing. Two Latino/a children with learning disabilities, Ana and Luis, used multiple cultural practices as resources, mixing and remixing their engagement in and identifications with mathematics. Ana, though mastering the procedural performances necessary for success in the second half of the year, authored herself as separate from mathematics, creating distance between herself and those she considered 'smarties.' Luis was identified as a creative mathematical problem-solver and was initially positioned as a 'top' mathematics student. As the pedagogy shifted towards memorization, Luis resisted the pedagogy of procedures and continued to identify as a creative thinker in mathematics. Yet, his teachers saw him as increasingly disabled and eventually placed him in a group only for those in special education. This group, which Luis named the 'unsmartest group,' was seen as least competent in mathematics by both teachers and students. The narratives of Luis and Ana highlight mathematics classrooms as relational and emotional and demonstrate different strategies of resistance to the construction of mathematical disability.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, we focus on an initiative in England devised to prepare non-mathematics graduates to train as secondary mathematics teachers through a 6-month Mathematics Enhancement Course (MEC) to boost their subject knowledge. The course documentation focuses on the need to develop 'understanding mathematics in-depth' in students in order for them to become successful mathematics teachers. We take a poststructural approach, so we are not interested in asking what such an understanding is, about the value of this approach or about the effectiveness of the MECs in developing this understanding in their participants. Instead we explore what positions this discourse of 'understanding mathematics in-depth' makes available to MEC students. We do this by looking in detail at the 'identity work' of two students, analysing how they use and are used by this discourse to position themselves as future mathematics teachers. In doing so, we show how even benign-looking social practices such as 'understanding mathematics in-depth' are implicated in practices of inclusion and exclusion. We show this through detailed readings of interviews with two participants, one of whom fits with the dominant discourses in the MEC and the other who, despite passing the MEC, experiences tensions between her national identity work and MEC discourses. We argue that it is vital to explore 'identity work' within teacher education contexts to ensure that becoming a successful mathematics teacher is equally available to all.</ab>

        <ab>Many mathematics classrooms use cooperative learning to support equitable learning environments for all students. Past research in the field has focused primarily on increasing achievement rather than on contexts that support equitable interactions. This year-long study in 3 secondary mathematics classes compares 2 activity structuresâa group quiz and a presentationâby examining group interaction within the 2 activities. The analysis shows that groups constructed a range of work practices, including a practice focused on collaboration, one focused on individual work, and one focused on âhelping.â In addition, students adopted a variety of positions, including expert, novice, in-between, and facilitator. In this data corpus, experts tended to dominate interactions during group quizzes, whereas presentation preparations were more equitable, particularly when a student was positioned as a facilitator. Based on the analysis, suggestions are provided for structuring more equitable mathematics group work.</ab>

        <ab>We investigated how secondary mathematics teachers check student geometry proofs. From video records of geometry-teachers checking proofs, we conjectured that teachers have different expectations for details that follow from written statements than for details that are conveyed by diagrams. To test our conjectures, we randomly assigned 44 secondary mathematics teachers to 1 of 3 experiment groups (n = 13, n = 15, n = 16) in which they viewed and rated representations of instructional practice. Participants in each group viewed treatment or control versions of instructional scenarios and rated the appropriateness of the teachers' work in different segments of each scenario. We compared participants' ratings across and within experiment groups. We found that participants rated lower instruction that deviated from what we hypothesized to be their expectations, confirming our hypotheses.</ab>

        <ab>The writer discusses how constructivist practice in her preservice teacher education mathematics course classified and marginalized her Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students according to racial stereotypes.  The teaching used encouraged students to actively construct mathematical and pedagogical knowledge in a supportive environment.  However, an analysis of three communications with students between 1991 and 1993 revealed that seemingly collaborative and mutually productive âactiveâ encounters with these minority students in fact positioned them as powerless within the discourse. These encounters caused these students to âknowâ their mandatory exclusion from such authoritative discourses as constructivist mathematics.  The writer's findings encouraged her to reassess her pedagogical practice, to think about how her practice could be more equitable and just, and to ascertain how a poststructuralist view of knowledge might prove instrumental in that quest.</ab>

        <ab>The rationale for the introduction of standards in the United States in the late 1980s was that the quality of education would improve. Assessment instruments in the form of written tests were constructed in order to perform a monitoring function. The introduction of standards and the associated monitoring have been replicated in South Africa. It was intended that these elements would result in a more equitable education across the country. In neither of these countries has this process borne the results expected. The lack of substantive progress may be due to the fact that socio-economic disadvantage and, therefore, opportunity to learn, has not been addressed. It may also be that systemic-type assessments have little meaning for the teachers, and bear little relation to classroom assessments; the perceived lack of relevance resulting in a lack of commitment to the process. Our education system is in need of serious deliberations about the broad curriculum goals relevant to society, a classroom environment that is conducive to learning and an assessment model that supports instruction. Within the assessment model we propose an instrument design that supports instruction. The assessment model includes a monitoring component, a formative component and a professional development component. We propose an assessment process where general trends can be reported for systemic purposes but also that the results of the individual learner progress obtained through both a monitoring and a formative component, are to be suitable for engagement by teachers. We honour the central teacher role in communicating both the emerging teaching successes and the currently troublesome areas of classroom learning challenges.</ab>

        <ab>Time is a valuable resource in academic careers. Empirical evidence suggests women faculty spend more time in campus service than men. Yet some studies show no difference when relevant variables are included. The primary source of data for most workload studies is cross-sectional surveys that have several weaknesses. This study investigated campus service inequality and factors that predict it at 1 research university using a novel and more comprehensive source of data - annual faculty reports. The investigation was guided by Kanterâs work on the role of power and representation and Lewis and Simpsonâs rereading of Kanterâs work to focus on gender, power, and representation. The authors examined 1,146 records of faculty campus service during 2 years. In both years, women faculty reported more total campus service than men while controlling for race, rank, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and the critical mass of women in a department. When considering levels of service, women reported higher numbers of service activities at the department and university levels. Women in male-dominated fields tended to have service workloads more like their peers and less like women in non-STEM fields. The article concludes with considerations regarding implications for organizing practices that maintain inequity between men and women in campus service.</ab>

        <ab>This study presents an analysis of whether geometry teachers create opportunities for student discussion when engaging students in proving as revealed through the use of a multimedia survey instrument. We presented 42 secondary mathematics teachers with 8 multimedia narratives set in the situation of doing proofs in high school geometry and asked them to choose what they would do next, presenting options that included a normative instructional action which closed off discussion and less typical actions that encouraged student discussion. Our analysis provides insight into the professional obligations that teachers use to justify their departure from the norm in order to encourage student talk as well as the background variables that are associated with such decisions. We found that while secondary mathematics teachers frequently chose to promote discussion in their classrooms, the rationale that they chose for this decision and the reasons they might choose not to immediately encourage discussion differed according to the amount of experience they had teaching geometry. We use these differences to illustrate how the professional obligations can be used to better understand how teacher decisions are rationalized at the level of the instructional situation.</ab>

        <ab>Educators today must be able to respond to the needs of an increasingly diverse student body and to teach all students the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed for civic participation in a globalized, pluralist society. While state departments of education and national teacher organizations have begun to adopt global awareness in their teaching standards and evaluation tools, there is a need for educators to understand what globally competent teachers actually do in classrooms across subject areas and grade levels. This qualitative, multiple case study explores the signature pedagogies (Shulman, 2005) of 10 in-service teachers in one southeastern state who teach for global competence in math, music, science, English, social studies, and language classes across elementary, middle, and high schools. We found three signature pedagogies that characterized globally competent teaching practices across participants: 1) intentional integration of global topics and multiple perspectives into and across the standard curriculum; 2) ongoing authentic engagement with global issues; and 3) connecting teachers' global experiences, students' global experiences, and the curriculum. These signature pedagogies provide visions of possibility for concrete practices teachers can adapt to infuse global citizenship education into their own contexts and for policies that school districts and teacher education programs can consider in preparing and supporting teachers in this work.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: We apply a literary definition of story (struggle, protagonist, and resolution) to an American primary school teacher''s reflections on experimenting with new teaching practices. This definition makes issues of equity explicit and revealed what the teacher saw as possible for changing her practice. By re-storying her stories â offering evidence from interviews, video, and surveys to affirm or complicate interpretations â we consider the power of storytelling to deepen commitments to reform and challenge skepticism. When done collaboratively between teacher educators and teachers, restorying could be a generative analytic process of learning from practice.</ab>

        <ab>We use matched employee-employer records from the teacher labor market to explore the effects of late teacher hiring on student achievement. Hiring teachers after the school year starts reduces student achievement by 0.042 SD in mathematics and 0.026 SD in reading. This reflects, in part, a temporary disruption effect in the first year. In mathematics, but not in reading, late-hired teachers remain persistently less effective, evidence of negative selection in the teacher labor market. Late hiring concentrates in schools that disproportionately serve disadvantaged student populations, contributing to challenges in ensuring an equitable distribution of educational resources for all students.</ab>

        <ab>The role of âcoflectionâ in school mathematics professional development is examined.  The professional development literature indicates an emphasis on subject matter and pedagogical content knowledge without specific attention to equity concerns as they emerge in professional development practice.  Moreover, teachers' assumptions underlying equity issues often remain unchecked in professional development practice.  However, coflection, an epistemic or knowledge-generating process, captures the socially critical nature of the interrelationships among teachers within professional learning experiences that are believed to be crucial for generating the kinds of knowledge teachers need to facilitate students' academic achievement.  Examples of practice from the literature and from research experiences are used to demonstrate that coflection centers equity concerns within teachers' professional development practice.</ab>

        </sug>
        <ab>In spite of sustained efforts tertiary institutions implement to try and improve student academic performance, the number of students succeeding in first-year mathematics courses remains disturbingly low. For most students, the gap between their mathematical capability and the competencies they are expected and need to develop to function effectively in these courses persists even after course instruction. In this study, an instrument for identifying and examining factors affecting student performance and success in a first-year Mathematics university course was developed and administered to 86 students. The overall Cronbach's Alpha coefficient for the questionnaire was found to be 0.916. Having identified variables from prior research known to affect student performance, factor analysis was used to identify variables exhibiting the greatest impact on student performance. The variables included prior academic knowledge, workload, student approaches to learning, assessment, student support teaching quality, methods and resources. From the analysis, students' perceptions of their workload emerged as the factor having the greatest impact on student's performance, followed by the matriculation examination score. The findings are discussed and strategies that can be used to improve teaching and contribute to student success in a first-year mathematics course in a South African context are presented.</ab>

        <ab>This study focuses on mathematics student teachersâ epistemological beliefs in mathematics and education. The study aimed at gaining insight into the challenges that students experience in the consolidation of knowledge in the two disciplines. The case study with three mathematics pre-service teachers utilised mathematical and pedagogical problem-solving tasks, interviews and stimulated recall. The findings suggest that epistemologies are domain-specific, and that students may struggle with the consolidation of mathematical and pedagogical knowledge. We identified six aspects that can challenge consolidation: the students believed that pedagogical knowledge is highly relative; their knowledge of methods of inquiry in education was weak; they viewed theoretical pedagogical knowledge as unrelated to practice; they held formalistic beliefs about mathematics; they were performance-orientated in solving the mathematical problems; and they relied on authority, rather than proof, as a justification for mathematical knowledge.</ab>

        <ab>BackgroundThis paper is a qualitative evaluation of a small-scale pilot study that attempted to generate parental involvement in childrenâs learning. It used problem-solving mathematics homework in order to raise the childrenâs self-efficacy, or, put another way, the childâs belief that success lies in their own hands. PurposeHomework is often seen as a common sense practice which is conducive to the development of the attributes of an effective learner. The pilot investigated whether situating homework tasks in everyday mathematical contexts enhanced parentâchild interaction. If so, the child was then more likely to commit to learning, recognise the usefulness of mathematics as a life skill, and the value of sharing ideas and accepting feedback. Design and methodsThe pilot took place between April and July 2015 in a primary school in the Northwest of England. Participants were a class of nine- and ten-year-old children (nÂ =Â 27), their two class teachers and a self-selecting sample of parents. Children were asked to work on open-ended problem-solving activities designed to connect with everyday use of mathematics. The parental role was to model, encourage and reinforce rather than instruct. Data was collected from focus groups, from parent feedback sheets and from a self-efficacy questionnaire. The data was analysed thematically. Findings and conclusionsDespite limitations of time and scale, evaluation of the pilot suggests that the homework strategy does justify further research. The qualitative analysis of the data indicates that greater involvement of parents in learning was generated, the homework was well received by children and self-efficacy levels remained stable. The next step should be to run an extended version of the pilot.</ab>

        <ab>Through the examination of a collection of macro factors and explanations for racial disparities in mathematics assessment found in the literature, this article takes up these accounts and problematizes the factors by unpacking the assumptions and exposing complexities. We do this using Critical Race Theory (CRT) to reinterpret and call out important blind spots. Essential questions that guided our analysis included: what macro factors has the field identified as influencing or explaining racial disparities in mathematics assessments? What assumptions undergird the fieldâs conversations about racial disparities in mathematics assessments? In what ways can those assumptions be challenged through CRT to highlight the story of race in the US? Our analysis reveals that the factors fall victim to a meritocratic premise that assumes all students are exposed to equivalent forms and amounts of mathematical knowledge. This assumption effectively locates the problem of assessment within students and not the institutions that are entrusted with providing access to mathematics curricular knowledge that is requisite for success. We conclude by arguing for a call to social action and continued policy measures with a renewed focus on equitable curricular access as an important method to improve the assessment outcomes for racial minority students.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this article is to explore structural competency as a framework for training in counseling psychology. Structural competency as a guiding paradigm can be an important component of counseling practice that is informed by an understanding of the effects of oppression and structural-level disparities on the psychological well-being of marginalized groups and individuals. We outline a set of training principles that can inform the development of socially responsive curricula in counseling psychology programs. These principles are derived from the need for an emancipatory, liberatory stance among newly trained practitioners and from the need for counseling psychologists to engage in anti-oppression advocacy. We argue that part of this advocacy must involve partnering with clients to counteract the over-reliance on de-contextualized treatments that ignore the role that individual and collective agency can play in bringing about positive psychological change.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Teacher educators need an awareness of orientations that prospective teachers (PSTs) hold about children's families and communities, so that they can support PSTs in developing positive perspectives and addressing deficit perspectives. Orientations expressed by 20 PSTs while in preK-8 mathematics methods courses are examined. Results from interviews indicate that PSTs recognize the importance of connecting with parents, understanding home and community practices, and building on these practices to support children's mathematical learning. They also, however, exhibit inconsistent perspectives, at times indicating a lack of understanding as to why some families appear to be less able to support students' academic efforts.</ab>

        <ab>There is little consensus on the kinds and amounts of teacher support needed to achieve desired student learning outcomes when mathematics is inserted into science classrooms. When supported by educative curriculum materials (ECM) and heavy investment in professional development (PD), teachers implementing a unit designed around mathematical modeling of scientific mechanisms substantially increased students' ability to make both qualitative and quantitative predictions (Schuchardt &amp; Schunn, 2016). Because of concerns about equitable access to support resources, we investigated whether variations in PD support while retaining ECM could differentially affect two student learning outcomes: Quantitative Predictions and Qualitative Predictions. Two contrasts were performed examining: (1) the effect of reducing PD and (2) whether eliminating PD entirely caused further harm to student learning. Reducing and eliminating PD had no significant effect on student gains in Qualitative Predictions, suggesting ECM can be sufficient for teachers to support student learning of conceptual science content. However, student gains in Quantitative Predictions decreased significantly upon reducing PD; eliminating PD did not cause significant additional decreases. Combined, these findings suggest that amount of face-to face PD support necessary to achieve student-learning gains can vary depending on whether the practice requires application of qualitative science content or quantitative reasoning.</ab>

        <ab>This article explores the benefits and challenges of operating an inclusive elementary and special education teacher preparation program within a disability studies framework. How does such a program balance issues of theory and practice? How does it provide students with a critical approach that essentially views disability as a social and cultural category much like race and gender, with a practical approach that attempts to address, remediate or eliminate those conditions that are considered disabling? How is it possible to become a successful professional with a disability studies perspective within a field such as special education that is traditionally based around a deficit model? The article provides recommendations for how such questions might be addressed in teacher education.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to determine best practices for enhancing 48 preservice teacher candidates' knowledge of gender equity and use of innovative instructional methods and strategies for developing classroom democratic social values. Initially, prior knowledge was assessed with a 20-item Likert-style rating scale instrument (pretest). Following the pretest assessment, group discussion addressing perceptions of equity, diversity, and equality in the classroom and initial attempts at constructing meaning and definition of each area was completed. After analysis, it was determined that initially, most preservice teacher candidates did not have much experience in equity training other than what they had observed or experienced in their own lives. Next, participants were immersed into selected current equity and diversity literature, observation of girls and boys in real classroom settings, and initial construction of what activities and approaches driven by equity, equality, and diversity would look like. As the semester progressed, marked development in understanding and application of appropriate methods and strategies in equitable classroom practices emerged. As closure, preservice teachers were assessed in a 20-item posttest. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: In this article, we argue for a new rationale for the science curriculum that is more coherent and more useful than the crosscutting concepts of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). In an effort to provide both clarity and justification for the science curriculum, we contend that a framework based on the idea that there are six styles of scientific reasoning will better guide teachers, curriculum designers, and assessment developers. While the NGSS set out to articulate the learning outcomes of the science curriculum as a set of performance expectations within three major scientific disciplines, we argue that the crosscutting concepts have no scholarly basis for what the sciences have in common. The consequence is that the NGSS make no case for the overâarching importance of specific performance expectations, include cross cutting concepts inconsistently across different grades, and provide no rationale for each standard. In contrast, we argue that the framework of styles of scientific reasoning does offer a coherent curriculum framework for the science curriculum from grades K through 12, a justification for each performance expectation, and a vision of how each standard might support the development of scientific reasoning. Implications for curriculum designers and educators are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: The push for STEM has raised the visibility of engineering as a discipline that all students should learn. With the release of the Framework for Kâ12 Science Education and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), engineering now has an official place in the science curriculum. In both the Framework and the NGSS, engineering is framed as a way to solve the world's greatest problems. Despite this potential, there are troubling aspects in the way that the Framework and NGSS present engineering and how engineering is taken up in the curriculum. In this article, we use critiques of technocracy, utilitarianism, and neoliberalism to analyze the portrayal of engineering in the Framework and NGSS. We claim that the Framework and NGSS promote a technocratic perspective that engineered solutions can all problems, ignoring the socioâpolitical foundations of many of the world's most pressing problems. Furthermore, both standards documents reflect a utilitarian ethic that promotes all progress as good and ignores issues of justice. Lastly, the Framework and NGSS betray neoliberal foundations that undermine education and engineering as public goods. To address some of these issues, others have argued for a greater emphasis on ethics. In response, we raise cautions because ethical framings present further intractable dilemmas. Instead, we draw on feminist theory to argue for reframing engineering education around an ethos of empathy and care. We call for a dimension of care that situates design problems in the full socioâpolitical context and centralizes issues of justice. We provide an illustration of how an NGSS example activity for designing solar cookers could incorporate a dimension of care that addresses issues of harm, power and inequality, and ecological (in)stability to provide students with opportunities to weigh and take responsibility for the real costs and benefits of their designs.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Counterspaces in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are often considered âsafe spacesâ at the margins for groups outside the mainstream of STEM education. The prevailing culture and structural manifestations in STEM have traditionally privileged norms of success that favor competitive, individualistic, and solitary practicesânorms associated with White male scientists. This privilege extends to structures that govern learning and mark progress in STEM education that have marginalized groups that do not reflect the gender, race, or ethnicity conventionally associated with STEM mainstream success, thus necessitating spaces in which the effects of marginalization may be countered. Women of color is one such marginalized group. This article explores the struggles of women of color that threaten their persistence in STEM education and how those struggles lead them to search out or create counterspaces. It also examines the ways that counterspaces operate for women of color in STEM higher education, particularly how they function as havens from isolation and microaggressions. Using a framework of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and intersectionality theory and drawing on interview data from 39 women of color about their STEM higher education experiences, we describe five ways in which counterspaces operate: in peerâtoâpeer relationships; mentoring relationships; national STEM diversity conferences; STEM and nonâSTEM campus student groups; and STEM departments. Whereas most research has discussed counterspaces as racially or ethnically homogeneous social groups of peers at the margins, our research found that counterspaces vary in terms of the race/ethnicity, gender, and power levels of participants. We found that counterspaces can be physical settings, as well as conceptual and ideological. Additionally, we identified counterspaces both at the margins and at the center of STEM departments. Thus, our research expands the existing understanding of the types and functions of counterspaces and broadens the definition of what locations can be and should be considered counterspaces.

        <ab>Israeli students ranked in the bottom third of the countries surveyed by PISA 2012 in mathematical literacy, while the gap between the highest and lowest scores was the second largest in the OECD. This paper explores which variables led to disparities in mathematical literacy between different socioeconomic levels and between Israeli Arabs and Jews as well as in comparison with Australian students. Different instructional approaches that are known in the literature to have a positive impact on students' achievement are not observed in the relationship between teachers and students in Israel. In Israel, schools contribute to the perpetuation of socioeconomically driven educational inequality by using tracks that are characterised by different teaching pedagogies and different content, with little or no upward mobility between tracks, leading to structural exclusion. By comparison, in Australia, ability tracking is less rigid and mathematical literacy far higher than in Israel. The policy implication is that either teachers must work differently in a track-based system to overcome the process of exclusion dictated by the structure itself or the system must reduce the use of tracking.</ab>

        <ab>The Common Core has brought a sharp shift in what it means to be mathematically literate. Becoming mathematically literate is now as much a matter of acquiring mathematical practices as of acquiring any defined set of content standards. This more ambitious definition of literacy presents a challenge not only for students, but also for teachers who are supposed to provide students with opportunities to persevere in challenging tasks. To achieve this, teachers need to relinquish just the right amount of control to the students; relinquishing too little constrains studentsâ opportunities to persevere; relinquishing too much runs the risk of students engaging in unsystematic exploration. The secret ingredient to making it just right is what we call Goldilocks Discourse.</ab>

        <ab>We developed a criterion-referenced student rating of instruction (SRI) to facilitate formative assessment of teaching. It involves four dimensions of teaching quality that are grounded in current instructional design principles: Organization and structure, Assessment and feedback, Personal interactions, and Academic rigor. Using item response theory and Wright mapping methods, we describe teaching characteristics at various points along the latent continuum for each scale. These maps enable criterion-referenced score interpretation by making an explicit connection between test performance and the theoretical framework. We explain the way our Wright maps can be used to enhance an instructor's ability to interpret scores and identify ways to refine teaching. Although our work is aimed at improving score interpretation, a criterion-referenced test is not immune to factors that may bias test scores. The literature on SRIs is filled with research on factors unrelated to teaching that may bias scores. Therefore, we also used multilevel models to evaluate the extent to which student and course characteristic may affect scores and compromise score interpretation. Results indicated that student anger and the interaction between student gender and instructor gender are significant effects that account for a small amount of variance in SRI scores. All things considered, our criterion-referenced approach to SRIs is a viable way to describe teaching quality and help instructors refine pedagogy and facilitate course development.</ab>

        <ab>This paper explores questions of relevance to Ethiopian primary education policy. It examines (i) the match/mismatch between government-prescribed pedagogy and actual student learning practices and (ii) the relationship between those practices and school, class and teacher level factors. The paper employs evidence from government documents on curriculum and pedagogy, time-based observations of 5,088 students in 776 mathematics classes and interviews with teachers. In recent years the government has prescribed a shift away from teacher-oriented towards student-centred methods of learning for both the first (Grades 1â4) and second (Grades 5â8) cycles of primary education with a target that 30% of class time be spent on student-centred activity. We find that student-centred activities accounted for just 10.7% of time spent, teacher-oriented activities 74.5% and âoff taskâ 14.7%, with first cycle students more âoff taskâ and second cycle students more âteacher-orientedâ. In both cycles a student is more likely to be âon taskâ rather than âoff taskâ if taught by a teacher with a Diploma or a degree, who has not been absent recently and has received supervision within the last four weeks; and more likely to be engaged in student-centred rather than teacher-oriented activity if taught by a female teacher with a Diploma. In the first cycle, âon taskâ activity is associated with female teachers; in the second cycle with male. In the first cycle student-centred activity is associated with class sizes of less than 26; in the second cycle with class sizes of more than 26 and with less experienced teachers. Policy implications are explored.</ab>

        <ab>The vignette we use as the introduction works to define and distinguish the concepts of de jure and de facto pedagogical actions, especially as related to Latin@ education and its relationship with STEM fields. The authors assert that de jure educational policies, which are often legal guidelines that mandate minimum levels of compliance, unfortunately become translated to mean the normative way to implement educational practice. Hence, going above and beyond the call of duty to educate Latin@ children and youth through culturally meaningful STEM practices while respecting, affirming, and utilizing decolonizing ways of viewing science and math is not viewed as standard. Thus, it is imperative that STEM educators who work with Latin@ learners demand that de jure education guidelines translated as de facto pedagogical actions are not enough. On the contrary, de jure and de facto ways of teaching and learning should always consist of a counterhegemonic normative.</ab>

        <ab>The evidence for providing sufficient opportunities for students to respond has been established in terms of student engagement and achievement in reading and mathematics. Although supported by research, the question remains whether teachers are incorporating this effective practice in their classroom instruction. This study examines the analysis of data from direct teacher observations during reading and mathematics instruction. Results from the analysis indicate that there is a statistically significant difference between teachers' rate of opportunities for students to respond across grade levels during mathematics and reading instruction. Although opportunities for students to respond rates across grade levels may vary, the rates at all grade levels are lower than recommended. Implications and areas of future research will be discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special issue on diversity, equity, and mathematical learning.  The writer argues that there is a need for a more clearly articulated research agenda relating to issues of equity and proposes a working definition of equity and a focal point for research.  Her definition of equity in mathematics teaching involves achievement and participation, the ability to question society through mathematical practices, and positive relationships between mathematics, people, and the planet in ways that erase inequities.  She contends that efforts to get marginalized students to master dominant mathematics must be coordinated with efforts to develop a critical perspective among all students about knowledge and society in ways that ultimately address a positive relationship between mathematics, people, and equity all around the world.  The writer maintains that a research agenda that emphasizes enabling the practice of teachers and that draws heavily on design-based and action research holds significant promise for addressing equity.</ab>

        <ab>Background/Context: Recent research in mathematics education has employed sociocultural and historical lenses to better understand how students experience school mathematics and come to see themselves as capable mathematics learners. This work has identified mathematics classrooms as places where power struggles related to students' identities occur, struggles that often involve students' affiliations with racial, ethnic, and gender categories and the mathematics teacher as a critical agent in students" mathematics identity development. Frameworks for identifying resources that mathematics teachers draw on to teach are evolving, and emerging dimensions of teachers' knowledge, namely knowledge of students' lived experiences and histories, as well as teachers' experiences and identities, are increasingly being considered alongside more traditional dimensions of the knowledge teachers draw on in their practice. Purpose" The purpose of this article is to explore the perspectives and practices of two African American mathematics teachers, Madison Morgan and Floyd Lee, as they support their African American students' mathematics identity formation and development. Participants: At the time of the study, Morgan and Lee were high school mathematics teachers in a large urban school district. Both participants were selected for this analysis because of considerable differences in their life histories, pedagogical approaches, and perspectives. Research Design: Each teacher was observed approximately 25 times and interviewed 9-10 times. The primary data for this analysis consist of a subset of observations and interviews for the purposes of conducting a qualitative cross-case analysis that examines themes, similarities, and differences in Morgan's and Lee's approaches to supporting their students' mathematics identity development. Findings: Morgan's and Lee's experiences, perspectives, and practices characterize two very different perspectives of what constitutes a positive mathematics identity, while both maintain connections to race and racial identities. In both cases, there exists a subtle paradox in the underlying motivations that the teachers communicated in their interviews related to socializing their African American students and the practices they actually employ in their classrooms. Furthermore, both teachers made use of their capacity to serve as models and motivators for students' current and future success in mathematics. Conclusions/Recommendations: If equitable high-quality mathematics instruction is a sincere goal of the mathematics education community, we strongly recommend that researchers further explore the ways that teacher identity, including those dimensions associated with race, class, and gender, serves as an instructional and motivational resource as teachers work to create productive and meaningful learning environments for their students.</ab>

        <ab>One way that STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) initiatives are being utilized is to encourage schools and teachers to integrate key science-based concepts into daily instruction. The reason is simple: it is more than just an instructional improvement or curricular enhancement; it is a research-based strategy that addresses the future needs of a technology-driven work force and sustaining a global economy. The importance of STEM is further validated by its prominence in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). One of the most effective instructional approaches toward the implementation of STEM in grade-level courses is through project-based learning. In project-based learning, instruction occurs through student-centered investigations focused on a specific topic driven by a set of objectives, culminating in a broadly defined product or technique. Projects foster an environment of discussion, creativity, problem solving, inquiry, modeling, and testing, and are applicable to students in all grade levels and subjects, but particularly within the STEM arena. In this paper, we describe a STEM-based project entitled ROAVEE (Remotely Operated Amphibious Vehicle for Environmental Exploration), which was initially introduced into a physics class but would later include the collaborative involvement of environmental science, robotics, and computer science students. This project challenged the students to design, model, construct, test, and navigate a robotic vehicle equipped with sensors that can collect environmental data in air and water.</ab>

        <ab>Effective professional development that influences teachers' classroom practices starts with what teachers know, understand, and do in their classroom. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) challenge teachers to make changes to their classroom; to help teachers make these changes, it is necessary to know what they are doing in their classrooms just prior to NGSS adoption. An online survey was distributed to high school chemistry teachers to understand their teaching practices before NGSS was adopted as state standards. This article presents the findings of the survey in terms of the chemistry content, science and engineering practices, and engineering content currently taught in chemistry. Gaps in the current teaching practices as they relate to the standards at the time of the study and NGSS are discussed, which show a challenge for the transformation of science education, which the implementation of NGSS hopes to achieve. Implications for professional development are included.</ab>

        <ab>American high school graduatesâ readiness for higher education or employment in the global economy may depend on the state where they live. Since the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution makes education a state function, the 50 states and the District of Columbia vary significantly in their policies and practices for (a) preschool access and enrollment, (b) compulsory attendance, (c) instructional standards, (d) school funding, and (e) student outcomes. The variance in state requirements and student outcomes is a high-stakes equity issue. If every child is to be well educated and prepared to live productively in the 21st century, principals, professional associations, and allies can assess their own statesâ policies and outcomes on these five criteria and determine where their advocacy may be needed to strengthen them.</ab>

        <ab>This study aimed to explore pre-service elementary teachers' (PSTs') conceptions of effective teacher talk in mathematics instruction, which were interpreted primarily based on the concept of communicative approach. This was accomplished through a task that involves analyzing and evaluating a sample teacher-student dialogue. This study specifically investigated: (a) aspects of the sample dialogue that PSTs attended to in critiquing the teacher talk, (b) PSTs' espoused conceptions of effective teacher talk in an authoritative-dialogic approach framework, and (c) comparison between PSTs' interpretations and the researchers' interpretation. Forty-six elementary PSTs engaged in the task and their responses were analyzed using the inductive content analysis approach. Findings showed that PSTs attended to various features of effective teacher-student dialogue; however, they paid more attention to the form of teacher talk than the function of it in context. PSTs' justifications used in evaluating the sample teacher-student dialogue showed some glaring differences from researchers' evaluations in regards to how the presented teacher talk would function in terms of the dialogic-authoritative spectrum. PSTs underscored affective support and clarity of teacher talk at its surface level, while showing strong resistance to the intentional vagueness within teacher talk, which might accommodate more dialogic engagement. This study suggests that initial teacher training programs should include more specific investment in PSTs' insights into effective use of classroom dialogue for learning.</ab>

        <ab>Makingis a rapidly emerging form of educational practice that involves the design, construction, testing, and revision of a wide variety of objects, using high and low technologies, and integrating a range of disciplines including art, science, engineering, and mathematics. It has garnered widespread interest and support in both policy and education circles because of the ways it has been shown to link science learning to creativity and investigation. Making has taken root in out-of-school settings, such as museums, science festivals, and afterschool and library programmes; and there is now growing interest from primary and secondary educators in how it might be incorporated into the classroom. Making expands on traditions associated with Technology Education and Design-Based Learning, but differs in ways that can potentially broaden participation in science and STEM learning to include learners from communities historically underrepresented in STEM fields. STEM-Rich Making is centrally organised around design and engineering practices, typically integrating digital tools and computational practices, and positions scientific and mathematical concepts and phenomena as the materials for design. This paper takes a critical view of the claims about Making as a productive form of science teaching and learning, and reviews the current research literatureâs substantiation of the ways in which Making supports studentsâ agency, promotes active participation in science and engineering practices, and leverages learnersâ cultural resources.</ab>

        <ab>The received view of mathematical practice is that mathematicians gain certainty in mathematical assertions by deductive evidence rather than empirical or authoritarian evidence. This assumption has influenced mathematics instruction where students are expected to justify assertions with deductive arguments rather than by checking the assertion with specific examples or appealing to authorities. In this article, we argue that the received view about mathematical practice is too simplistic; some mathematicians sometimes gain high levels of conviction with empirical or authoritarian evidence and sometimes do not gain full conviction from the proofs that they read. We discuss what implications this might have, both for mathematics instruction and theories of epistemic cognition.</ab>

        <ab>Although using higher rates of positive to negative feedback is one best practice often recommended to teachers, particularly when it comes to students experiencing behavioral problems in classroom settings, research on the use of positive feedback in classroom teaching practice has revealed inconsistent results. Research has documented fluctuations in trends of teachersâ use of positive feedback strategies, justifying further inquiry into the current state of classroom practice. This study aimed to examine the current state of classroom feedback practices among teachers of a district who were asked to rate their students' risk levels for developing emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD). The researchers found that students identified as high risk and low risk for EBD received teacher feedback at a significantly different rate. Students identified as high risk for EBD received negative feedback at a higher rate than their same-setting peers. Implications for teachers on the use of feedback for students at-risk for EBD are presented.</ab>

        <ab>One of the learning goals for social justice education courses is to prepare students for social action engagement. Teaching students about issues related to social justice is complex. Prior studies have found a positive relationship between student enrollment in social justice education courses and action-oriented outcomes. While these findings are promising, we as social justice educators need to know more about effective teaching strategies used in social justice education courses that prepare students for social action. In this article, the author describes one method she designed using social justice vignettes to help students recognize social oppression in their daily lives and practice interrupting various âismsâ in a safe classroom environment.</ab>

        <ab>Background/Context: A number of recent policies have specifically attacked immigrants and English Language Learners (ELLs), including Georgia's HB 8 7 (2011), Arizona's SB 1070 (2010), and Alabama's HB 56 (2011), among others. The policy focus of this study is Arizona's HB 2064 (2006), which added additional requirements that mandate tracking students by English language proficiency and separating English language instruction from subject matter for ELL students. Few scholars have considered how these broad social policies impact professional development (PD)-induced classroom change, especially in mathematics education. This sociopolitical context cannot help but affect teachers' willingness to take on new practices in PD and thus affect educational opportunities for Latinos and English Language Learners. Yet, policies that target ELLs have not received much attention within mathematics education or PD. This exploratory study details teacher change produced by mathematics PD efforts before and after a new ELL) policy was implemented in order to better understand this intersection. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The teachers in this study participated in mathematics professional development focusing on Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI). This exploratory research documents how teachers experimented in their classrooms before and after this policy was implemented and teachers' views of HB 2064. Two research questions guided the study: 1) How did the mathematics PD affect change in teacher knowledge and classroom practice? and 2) How did the conflicting policy and PD efforts influence change in elementary mathematics instruction ? Setting: This research took place in the Monroe Elementary School District, an urban school district in Arizona. Three schools participated in mathematics professional development based on CGI principles. The student population was 95% Hispanic and 46% ELLs, and 89% of students received free or reduced lunch. Therefore, Arizona's policies had the potential to greatly impact the student population in this school. Population/Participants/Subjects: The professional development was implemented with three groups of K-3 teachers (n=44). Across the PD, just over one fourth of participating teachers were bilingual in Spanish and English. Intervention/Program/Practice: The professional development focused on the principles of CGI, combining earlier work on student strategies and problem types (Carpenter, Fennema, Franke, Levi, &amp; Empson, 1999) with more recent work on algebraic thinking (Carpenter, Franke, &amp; Levi, 2003) and counting (Schwerdtfeger &amp; Chan, 2007). This model of professional development focuses teachers on the development of student thinking, problem types for various mathematical operations, and building instruction from this knowledge base. The PD consisted of monthly on-site workgroup meetings and weekly on-site visits to support teachers in their classrooms. Research Design- The research team conducted a mixed methods study of teacher change across the district. The study followed teachers for two years--one year before the policy was implemented and the year it was implemented--documenting the practices teachers maintained in their elementary mathematics classrooms. The study used a mixed methods design to respond to the two research questions (Creswell, 2003). A teacher knowledge assessment was used to see if teachers were gaining new knowledge as they implemented the principles of the PD. Observations allowed for the study to look at teacher experimentation in classrooms. Finally, an interview on the policy and its impact on their classroom practices was performed to add more understanding to why teachers did or did not implement more PD practices. Findings/Results: Teacher knowledge change was minimal across the professional development. However, the data on change in practice suggest that more practices were adopted before the policy was implemented than during implementation. In contrast, teachers reported that the policy had minimal effect on their mathematics instruction. This conflict, between change in practice and the perceived lack of policy impact, seemed to be due to teachers' view of mathematics and language as fundamentally separate. It also was related to an alignment between teacher beliefs and the views embedded in the policy. Conclusions/Recommendations: The findings raise concerns about the conflict between PD and policy in generating teacher change. New questions emerge from this work about taking into consideration the sociopolitical context when researching PD efforts focused on intersections between policy and subject matter. Questions also emerge about the alignment of ideology in policy with teachers' beliefs. The authors call for work in mathematics PD that takes on the intersections between policies and PD efforts and that targets particular student populations. Additionally, more research would be beneficial for understanding the impact of the sociopolitical context on teacher change efforts.</ab>

        <ab>In a high-stakes assessment culture, it is clearly important that learners of mathematics develop the necessary fluency and confidence to perform well on the specific, narrowly defined techniques that will be tested. However, an overemphasis on the training of piecemeal mathematical skills at the expense of more independent engagement with richer, multifaceted tasks risks devaluing the subject and failing to give learners an authentic and enjoyable experience of being a mathematician. Thus, there is a pressing need for mathematical tasks which embed the practice of essential techniques within a richer, exploratory and investigative context. Such tasks can be justified to school management or to more traditional mathematics teachers as vital practice of important skills; at the same time, they give scope to progressive teachers who wish to work in more exploratory ways. This paper draws on the notion of a musical Ã©tude to develop a powerful and versatile approach in which these apparently contradictory aspects of teaching mathematics can be harmoniously combined. I illustrate the tactic in three central areas of the high-school mathematics curriculum: plotting Cartesian coordinates, solving linear equations and performing enlargements. In each case, extensive practice of important procedures takes place alongside more thoughtful and mathematically creative activity.</ab>

        <ab>This article provides a brief introduction to critical pedagogy and further discussion on critical mathematics education. Critical mathematics education enables students to read the world with mathematics. Three emerging domains of mathematics education related to critical mathematics education are discussed in this manuscript: ethnomathematics, equity in mathematics education and culturally responsive teaching. All three of these domains share the purpose of creating just and democratic classrooms while they provide different means to reach this purpose. Ultimately, the goal of the critical mathematics education is to empower students with knowledge, skills and dispositions needed to create democratic communities embracing social justice in and outside of school.

        <ab>Colleges and universities incorporate international, student-teaching programs as a way to help prepare globally minded prospective teachers. This article adds to this conversation, offering insight from a multicase study analysis of three educators conducted 5 years after their experience student teaching in Kenya, East Africa. The researcher focused on evidence that related to holistic global perspective, informed by theories of cosmopolitan citizenship. Three cases are highlighted to compare the data that were gathered when the preservice teachers participated in a critical ethnography conducted between 2007 and 2008 with interview data collected 5 years later. This follow-up study demonstrated the participantsâ perceptions of their student-teaching abroad experience over time. Two themes emerged when analyzing the data across cases: (1) extended post-travel reflection strengthens participantsâ intrapersonal awareness, (2) individuals felt a desire to become cultural conduits âwith responsibilityâ once returning to the United States. Finally, participants demonstrated a respect for humanity, justice, and cultural pluralism, one premise of moral cosmopolitanism. However, they did not show evidence they were willing to engage students in the second premise, democratic deliberation and moral reasoning.</ab>

        <ab>In order to describe and analyze teachers' orchestrating of classroom discourse, detailed descriptions of teachers' comments and questions are critical. The purpose of this article is to suggest new concepts that enable us to describe in detail how teachers use or do not use students' comments to work with the mathematical content. Five teachers from upper primary school (grades five to seven, students aged 10 to 13) were studied. Beginning with the analysis of a pattern where the teacher gives a confirmation followed by a question that indicates a rejection, their practices form the basis for the development of 13 categories of teacher comments. These categories are then grouped into redirecting, progressing, and focusing actions. The categories and their groupings shed light on tools and techniques which these teachers use to make student strategies visible, to make students justify, apply and assess, to ensure progress towards a conclusion, or to redirect the students into alternative approaches. These findings can help us develop in the direction of a more profound understanding of how communication affects learning.</ab>

        <ab>There is a gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This presents a worldwide problem of inequity. Sociocultural stereotypes associating STEM with males act as barriers that prevent girls from developing interests in STEM. This article aims to show that we can increase equity and enhance outcomes for a broader number of children around the world by integrating psychological and educational science. The article discusses four strands of research in an effort to build a bridge between psychological science and educational practice and policy. First, it describes how stereotypes can act as barriers that prevent girls from developing interests in STEM. Second, it summarizes psychological experiments demonstrating that counteracting stereotypes can increase girls' interest in enrolling in STEM courses. Third, it examines new results showing that children adopt the pervasive stereotypes of their culture starting from surprisingly young ages, and it shows that children's stereotypes influence their academic attitudes and performance. Fourth, it describes innovative practical interventions that can increase and equalize motivation and engagement in STEM for both boys and girls. In each of these sections, the authors link scientific findings with educational applications. Cultural stereotypes contribute to educational inequities, but scientists, educators, and policymakers can together make a difference to reduce stereotyping and boost girls' interest in STEM worldwide.</ab>

        <ab>Instructional improvement initiatives in many districts include instructional coaching as a primary form of job-embedded support for teachers. However, the coaching literature provides little guidance about what activities coaches should engage in with teachers to improve instruction. When researchers do propose activities, they rarely justify why those activities might support teacher learning. Drawing on the preservice and inservice teacher education literatures, we present a conceptual analysis of learning activities that have the potential to support mathematics and science teachers to improve practice. We argue that our analysis can inform research on mathematics and science coaching, coaching policies, and the design of professional learning for coaches.</ab>

        <ab>In England and Wales government pressures to raise attainment has led many schools to implement structured âabilityâ grouping in the form of setting. The introduction of selective grouping has been justified with the assumption that the differentiation of students by âabilityâ advances studentsâ motivation, social skills, independence and academic success in national tests and examinations because students are âbetter engaged in their own learningâ. This paper critically engages with this assumption. Drawing upon qualitative research conducted in primary and secondary mathematics, science and English setted classrooms in England the aim of this literature review is to consider how teachersâ pedagogic practices with low, middle and high âabilityâ sets facilitates and/or constrains studentsâ learning and potential achievement. We also explore why, despite strenuous criticism and moves towards egalitarianism in schools, the segregation of students on the basis of âabilityâ continues to be a common feature in schools in England and Wales. This literature review draws attention to a number of substantive issues including (but not restricted to) fixed and permanent grouping; the potential misplacement of students to sets and a culture of stereotyping where learners within a set are taught as a single homogenous unit. We conclude the paper by suggesting foci for future research in the hope of eliciting renewed critical interest in and investigation of setting by âabilityâ in a broader range of subjects of the curriculum.</ab>

        <ab>According to the design principle of progressive schematization, learning trajectories towards procedural rules can be organized as independent discoveries when the learning arrangement invites the students first to develop models for mathematical concepts and model-based informal strategies; then to explore the strategies and to discover pattern for progressively developing procedural rules. This article contributes to the theoretical and empirical foundation of the design principle of progressive schematization by empirically investigating students' individual schematization pathways on the micro-level for the specific case of part-of-part determination of fractions. In design experiments series in laboratory settings, nine pairs of sixth graders explored the part-of-part determination and progressively schematized their graphical strategies before discovering the procedural rule. The qualitative in-depth analysis of 760 min of video shows that progressive schematization is a multi-facetted process that cannot be described by internalization of graphical procedures alone. Instead, the compaction of concepts- and theorems-in-action is crucial, especially for the goal of justifiable procedural rules.</ab>

        <ab>Through the multiple languages of the arts, many ideas about sustainability can be explored with young children. This paper discusses the ethical issues involved in the implementation of a research study that uses artist Chris Jordan's confronting images about sustainability. Jordan's images typically depict tens of thousands of objects such as plastic cups, garbage and threatened species. The specific purpose of this paper is to explore the ethical tensions around presenting such images to children. Confounded by images of large numbers and confronted by traumatic images of dead birds, how might children access the enormity of the sustainability issues explored in Jordan's work? Researchers and educators have a responsibility to ensure children are not harmed through our work with them, so careful planning and ethical practices are essential. However, there are strong grounds for presenting such powerful images as educative tools and for generating useful conversations with children about mass consumption, pollution and unsustainable practices. Conclusions are drawn that the ethical challenges and risks in using Chris Jordan's images are worth taking in order to create new ways of discussing sustainability through the arts.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines what students enrolled in the honors and general sections of a high school biology course offered at the same school learn when they have an opportunity to participate in a broad or narrow range of science practices during their laboratory experiences. The results of our analysis suggest that the students enrolled in the general sections of the course made similar or larger gains than the students enrolled in the honors section of the course in their abilities to plan and carry out an investigation, argue from evidence, and write a science-specific persuasive essay when these students had an opportunity to participate in a broad range of science practices. These findings suggest that laboratory experiences that give students an opportunity to participate in a broad range of science practices, although considered challenging by many teachers, have the potential to help all students become more proficient in science. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of this study for classroom instruction and educational policy.</ab>

        <ab>A study examined the content of 26 poster presentations of mathematics or science lessons incorporating social justice issues made by student teachers at a midsized college in central New York State.  Findings revealed that the presented lessons applied four pedagogical approaches to integrationâdata collection followed by graphing analysis, discussion of text/video, modeling, and library/Internet investigationâand addressed three major social justice themesâdiversity, system disparities in human communities, and system disparities in stewardship of Earth.</ab>

        <ab>This ethnographic study examined studentsâ opportunities to learn in linguistically diverse mathematics classrooms in a Canadian elementary school. I specifically examined the contextual change of group work, which influenced opportunities to learn for newly arrived English language learners (ELLs). Based on analyses of video-recorded interactions, this study revealed a shift in these ELLsâ opportunities to learn from when they worked with teacher-assigned peers to when they worked with friends. In both settings, ELLs tended to be positioned as novices. However, when working with friends, they accessed a wider variety of work practices. In friend groups, ELLs were occasionally positioned as experts and had more opportunities to raise questions and offer ideas. In contrast, when working with teacher-assigned peers, ELLs tended to remain in the position of being helped. In some teacher-assigned groups, interactions were characterized as authoritative, and ELLsâ contributions and ideas were rejected or neglected without relevant justifications or mathematical authority established by their peers. The findings contribute to ongoing discussions on group work and friendship in linguistically diverse classrooms.</ab>

        <ab>Mathematics is not a race-neutral subject. Access and opportunity in mathematics for students of color in the United States continue to be limited. While a great deal of attention has been given to increasing the number of underrepresented minority students in the mathematics pipeline, there is little consideration of who they are as learners or the context in which their mathematics learning takes place. We argue that culturally relevant instruction coupled with teaching for social justice can motivate marginalized students to learn mathematics. Throughout this conceptual article, we (a) explore the theoretical frameworks underlying culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) and social justice pedagogy (SJP), (b) present illustrative cases of mathematics teaching that reveal the possibilities and challenges associated with these pedagogical approaches, and (c) offer to the field of teacher education recommendations related to the successful use of CRP and SJP within today's classrooms.</ab>

        <ab>This exploratory qualitative study examined faculty responses to a collegiality-building process called Dialogues. The process used a series of discussions and activities to guide faculty members toward a common, mutually beneficially goal, while changing patterns of interaction. The responses revealed how faculty members experienced collegiality-building practices, including individual reflection, small group discussions, idea generation and prioritization, and consensus-building. The study examined faculty responses within STEM departments. We conclude with recommendations for encouraging inclusive and participatory departmental norms and behaviors in order to promote a positive departmental climate, which is crucial to achieving equity in all disciplines of the academia.</ab>

        <ab>Recent years have seen an increase in the use of video for teacher education and professional development accompanied by widespread recognition that to be beneficial, video must be used in activities that induce particular modes of inquiry. However, little is known about how teachers typically watch video. The present study investigates the use of five strategies that teachers use for making sense of classroom instruction that they have watched on video. Data was collected from 15 middle and high school mathematics teachers who watched four 3-8 minute clips of instruction and described what they had just viewed. Results indicate that teachers employ a variety of sense-making strategies while interpreting classroom video. Implications for teacher research and professional development are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>There has been a period of intense policy change involving GCSE examinations in England, proposed partly in response to schools using tactics to maximise performance against accountability measures. The reforms included a change to linear rather than modular entry, removing partial re-sits, and limiting early and multiple entry to examinations by changing school accountability measures. We present new empirical data from interviews conducted with senior teachers at 15 schools. The focus of these interviews has been in the English and mathematics departments; the first subjects to be examined in the new specifications. The data suggest that teachers acknowledge this practice of âgamingâ but only as something âotherâ schools did. Whilst the reforms have now allowed for the system to be viewed as a more level playing field, teachers still describe a constant tension in the decisions surrounding examination entry. They describe the desire for a balance that is not just between school and student outcomes, but also between different outcomes such as motivation, performance, and engagement. Tensions arise between these outcomes when entry choices are being made.</ab>

        <ab>Although many policy documents include equity as part of mathematics education standards and principles, researchers continue to explore means by which equity might be supported in classrooms and at the institutional level. Teaching practices that include opportunities for students to engage in active learning have been proposed to address equity. In this paper, through aligning some characteristics of inquiry put forth by Cook, Murphy and Fukawa-Connelly with GutiÃ©rrez's dimensions of equity, we theoretically explore the ways in which active learning teaching practices that focus on inquiry could support equity in the classroom.</ab>

        <ab>Mentoring is too important to be left to chance (Ganser, 1996), yet mentoring expertise of teachers varies widely, which may present inequities for developing preservice teachers' practices. Five factors for mentoring have been identified herein: personal attributes, system requirements, pedagogical knowledge, modelling, and feedback, and items associated with each factor have also been justified in context of the literature. An original, literature-based survey instrument gathered 446 preservice teachers' perceptions of their mentoring for primary teaching. Data were analysed within the above-mentioned five factors with 331 final-year preservice teachers from nine Australian universities responding to their mentoring for science teaching and 115 final-year preservice teachers from an urban university responding to their mentoring for mathematics teaching. Results indicated similar Cronbach alpha scores on each of the five factors for primary science and mathematics teaching; however percentages and mean scores on attributes and practices aligned with each factor were considerably higher for mentoring mathematics teaching compared with science teaching.</ab>

        <ab>A study examined meaning-making and justification in the way mathematics is taught.  Data were collected from previous descriptions of teaching dilemmas, particularly problems identified in the classrooms of two reform-oriented South African teachers.  Findings revealed two key problems:  whether or not to press particular learners' meanings and whether to take up or ignore learner contributions.  These dilemmas are supported by the âpressâ move of reform pedagogy.  These problems come together to create a third overarching problem:  the dilemma between working with learners' meanings and encouraging justification.</ab>

        <ab>This study explores opportunities to learn mathematics problem solving for Latina/o students in 3 kindergarten classrooms in the southwest. Mixed methods were used to examine teaching practices that engaged Latina/o students in problem solving and supported their learning. Findings indicate that although students in all 3 classrooms showed growth on pre-/postassessment measures, students in Ms. Arenas's classroom outperformed students in the 2 other classrooms. More time spent on problem solving; exposure to a broader range of problems involving multiplication, division, and multiple steps; and consistent access to students' native language, Spanish, distinguished Ms. Arenas's class.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes research into the beliefs and practices established over time by teachers, who had been engaged in an innovative `mathematical investigations' school program, based on the use of exploratory software. The theoretical framework perceives the teacher as an active mediator of innovation, constructing and reorganizing a personal pedagogy. Interview and detailed observa- tional classroom data were collected and analyzed, synthesizing qualitative and quantitative interpretations of teachers' comments in the classroom. The results show that teachers refer to a variety of aspects of the learning situations in which they intervene rather than just the mathematical concepts and ideas. They adopt multiple roles in the classroom and are influenced by the values of the educational system. The ways in which these issues influence teaching and learning of the mathematical concepts at hand is considered. The nature of teacher beliefs and the ways in which they may influence their practice is questioned.</ab>

        <ab>There is a growing awareness of the need to move beyond generic approaches to teaching, learning and assessment (TLA) to consider the importance of context in shaping TLA practices. However, efforts to engage with context have focused primarily on disciplinary epistemologies and in particular the differences between hard, soft, pure and applied disciplines. This paper argues that disciplines should be considered not just in terms of epistemological differences, but as socially situated practices. This research is based on interviews with 30 academics across 4 merging disciplinary workgroups of a South African university. A framework for exploring TLA workgroup cultures is proposed, drawing on a modified communities of practice theory (COPT), that moves beyond functionalist accounts of socially situated practices in COPT to focus on how departmental TLA cultures mediate between individual agency and a range of structural factors. When looking at disciplinary TLA cultures through this lens this research found that what was more significant than the differences between disciplines based on epistemological difference were differences in the ways academic workgroups mediated between the knowledge structures of the discipline and the challenges of a society in transition with competing expectations of students, knowledge, the state, marketization, and the demands for reconstruction and development. It was thus the work done in localised workgroups on disciplinary epistemologies in response to a range of contextual factors that was found to be more significant than differences between the disciplines in defining TLA cultures.</ab>

        <ab>A premise that demonstrates how values in most U.S. classrooms are consistent with characteristics of competitive democracy is illustrated by some excerpts from student interviews.  By itself, the opportunity to participate is not sufficient.  Instead, one should approach the teaching of mathematics by building on the values of participatory democracy and by incorporating the values of dialogue democracy.  An emphasis on creating a space facilitating dialogue about learning is essential if one wishes to develop environments capable of engaging a diverse range of students.</ab>

        <ab>The paper explores a conceptual approach to the question of what it means to provide a university education that addresses equity, and encourages the formation of STEM graduates oriented to public-good values and with commitments to making professional contributions to society which will advance human well-being. It considers and rejects resource-based and utilitarian approaches to well-being and opts for Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum's capabilities approach which involves developing graduates' capabilities and functionings to be and do in ways which they have reason to value. The capabilities approach argues for educational and social development as the expansion of such freedoms. The approach is sensitive also to diversity through the focus on the choice of a plurality of functionings and a wide informational basis for policy, practice and social justice evaluations. It allows an analysis of how different individuals can convert available resources into functionings through attending to conversion factors: personal (internal) conversion factors, social conversion factors and environmental (external) conversion factors. All make a difference to how an individual converts her resources into functionings and makes advantage and disadvantage visible. There is a further education-specific issue, that of selecting core valuable capabilities because not any form of science and engineering education will do. Educators need to deliberate and agree which capabilities and corresponding functionings are valuable and so should be supported in policy and practice. In a capabilities-friendly education, education would aim to secure and distribute valuable education capabilities to diverse students (women and men, black and white, rural and urban and so on) paying attention to the social arrangements in education (pedagogies, institutional culture and education policy) and to conversion factors and barriers that might impede the development of opportunities and valued outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this article is two-fold. First, it reports on a study of the distribution of reform-oriented instructional practices among Black, White and Hispanic students, and the relationship between those practices and student achievement. The study identified many similarities in instruction across student groups, but there were some differences, such as Black and Hispanic students being assessed with multiple-choice tests significantly more often than were White students. Using hierarchical linear modeling, this study identified several significant positiveâand no negativeârelationships between reform-oriented practices and 4th-grade student achievement. Specifically, teacher emphasis on non-number mathematics strands, collaborative problem solving, and teacher knowledge of the NCTM Standards were positive predictors of achievement. An analysis of interaction effects indicated that the relationships between various instructional practices and achievement were roughly similar for White, Black and Hispanic students.  The second purpose of this article is to make comparisons with another study that used the same NAEP data, but drew very different conclusions about the potential for particular instructional practices to alleviate inequities. A study published in EPAA by Wenglinsky (2004) concluded that school personnel can eliminate race-related gaps within their schools by changing their instructional practices. Similarities and differences between these two studies are discussed to illuminate how a researcher's framing, methods, and interpretations can heavily influence a study's conclusions. Ultimately, this article argues that the primary conclusion of Wenglinsky's study is unwarranted.Keywords: equity, hierarchical linear modeling; mathematics achievement; mathematics instruction; NAEP.

        <ab>Why do schools teach the mathematics that they do? In this essay, Houman Harouni asserts that educational institutions offer mathematics standards and curricula without providing convincing justifications and that students are tested on content whose purpose neither they nor their teachers clearly understand. He proposes a theoretical framework for understanding the content and pedagogy of school mathematics as a set of practices reflecting sociopolitical values, particularly in relation to labor and citizenship. Beginning with a critical study of the history of mathematics instruction, Harouni traces the origins of modern math education to the early institutions in which mathematics served a clear utilitarian purpose, and in the process he unearths common, unexamined assumptions regarding the place and form of mathematics education in contemporary society.</ab>

        <ab>'Ability' or attainment grouping can introduce an additional label that influences teachers' expectations of students in specific attainment groups. This paper is based on a survey of 597 teachers across 82 schools and 34 teacher interviews in 10 schools undertaken as part of a large-scale mixed-methods study in England. The paper focuses on English and mathematics teachers' expectations of secondary school students in lower attainment groups, and explores how low-attaining students are constructed as learners who benefit from specific approaches to learning justified through discourses of nurturing and protection. The authors argue that the adoption of different pedagogical approaches for groups of low-attaining learners to nurture them may in some cases be fostering dependency on teachers and cap opportunities for more independent learning. Furthermore, more inclusive whole-school learning-culture approaches may better allow for students across the attainment range to become independent learners.</ab>

        <ab>We present a theoretical framework that views learning as a process involving content learning (CL) and identity construction (IC). We view identities as lenses through which people make sense of, and position themselves, through stories and actions, and as lenses for understanding how they are positioned by others. As people become more (or less) central members of a disciplinary community (e.g., a science or mathematics classroom) and engage (or not) in various cultural practices, changes in identity and knowledge accompany changes in position and status. IC and CL share an important characteristic: they both involve meaning making. For IC, it is the development of reasoned, coordinated, coherent, and meaningful ways of seeing one's self in relation to communities, and for CL, it centers on the development of disciplinary concepts, processes, tools, language, discourse, and norms within practices. Focusing on Black students in mathematics and science classrooms, we claim that three intersecting identities are particularly important: disciplinary identity (as doers of the discipline, i.e., mathematics and science), racial identity (emerging understandings of what it means to be Black), and academic identity (as participants in academic tasks and classroom practices). In this paper, we elaborate on the CLIC framework as a useful tool for understanding how Black students negotiate participation in, and come to see themselves as doers of science and mathematics in their school classrooms. We synthesize empirical findings from our research with younger and older students, as well as with parents and community members, to illustrate dimensions of this framework. Copyright Â© 2013 S.

        <ab>Despite the fact that grade retention is now seen as controversial in many quarters, it remains common practice in numerous countries. Previous research on the effects of grade retention on student development has, however, generated ambiguous results, particularly in terms of motivational outcomes. This ambiguity has been attributed in part to a lack of high-quality studies including a longitudinal design, a suitable comparison group, and adequate statistical control of preretention differences. Based on longitudinal data of N = 3,288 German students over 3 years of secondary school, we examined differences in their academic self-concept, scholarly interests, learning motivation, and achievement motivation between those being retained in the 6th grade (n = 61) and those of the same age being promoted annually. To account for confounding variables, we applied full propensity score matching on baseline measures of the dependent variables, as well as various other covariates that have been found to be associated with the risk of retention (e.g., cognitive ability, academic performance, and family background variables). Results reveal a steep decline in students' academic self-concept, interests, and learning motivation during the last months spent in the original class, just before retention. For those measures that were available, negative effects were still partly significant after 1 year, but had diminished 2 years after grade retention. Contrary to predictions suggested by the big-fish-little-pond effect, we found no positive effects of retention on students' academic self-concept. Based on German data, we examined how grade retention in secondary school affects students' motivation not only during the period after retention took place, but also in the period in which decisions on retention are made. We could not find any evidence for positive effects of grade retention on students' motivational development. Instead, we found a considerable decline in students' learning motivation, academic interests and students' beliefs in their academic abilities when they were faced imminent retention at the end of the school year. Accordingly, the results of the present study suggest that, if a student does not reach the criteria for being promoted to the next grade, teachers and parents should provide positive feedback and support to prevent a motivational dip that might be caused by students' anticipation of imminent retention. Furthermore, our study strengthens the evidence that German policymakers need to find alternatives for grade retention.</ab>

        <ab>The purposes of this qualitative case study were to describe the design and the development of a maker-centered learning environment and curriculum by an interdisciplinary team, and to explore how an after-school program that incorporated Maker education and scientific argumentation influenced middle school youths' attitudes toward science in the Midwestern USA. The researchers conducted pre- and post-interviews with six students from non-dominant backgrounds and the teacher, and also administered attitudinal surveys to the six students at two time points (pre/post). Additionally, the researchers video-recorded each after-school session, observed the level of student participation in each activity, and examined student artifacts. At the end of the program, the researchers administered a program survey to the six students. The findings revealed a number of themes. This after-school program eased the tension from the formal science learning with the playful qualities of Making activities and developed the students' practice of social negotiation, which sustained their liking of science. The Making and scientific argumentation activities provided an opportunity to contextualize STEM concepts and practices, which allowed the students to value science by re-affirming as well as expanding their career choices. The Making and scientific argumentation activities helped boost confidence that, up to that point, had been decreasing in formal science learning contexts. The findings speak to the need for future studies that investigate pedagogy issues in Making after-school programs and also examine equity issues in the opportunities for non-dominant youth to participate in these programs.</ab>

        <ab>The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics calls for an increased emphasis on proof and reasoning in school mathematics curricula. Given such an emphasis, mathematics teachers must be prepared to structure curricular experiences so that students develop an appreciation for both the value of proof and for those strategies that will assist them in developing proving skills. Such an outcome is more likely when the teacher feels secure in his/her own understanding of the concept of 'mathematical proof' and understands the ways in which students progress as they take on increasingly more complex mathematical justifications. In this article, a model of mathematical proof, based on Balacheff's Taxonomy of Mathematical Proof, outlining the levels through which students might progress as they develop proving skills is discussed. Specifically, examples of the various ways in which students operating at different levels of skill sophistication could approach three different mathematical proof tasks are presented. By considering proofs under this model, teachers are apt to gain a better understanding of each student's entry skill level and so effectively guide him/her toward successively more sophisticated skill development.</ab>

        <ab>Some researchers have expressed doubts about the potential of reform-oriented curricula to promote equity. This article considers this important issue and argues that investigations into equitable teaching must pay attention to the particular practices of teaching and learning that are enacted in classrooms. Data are presented from two studies in which middle school and high school teachers using reform-oriented mathematics curricula achieved a reduction in linguistic, ethnic, and class inequalities in their schools. The teaching and learning practices that these teachers employed were central to the attainment of equality, suggesting that it is critical that relational analyses of equity go beyond the curriculum to include the teacher and their teaching.

        <ab>Between 2012 and 2018, the California Community Colleges system underwent significant changes in policy and practice to address student success rates; this article chronicles policies affecting ESL students and how ESL faculty worked to ensure equitable, appropriate implementation for students enrolled in credit ESL courses. The 2018 California law, AB 705 (Irwin) and its partner bill, AB 1805 (Irwin), changed placement processes; impact was greatest in the disciplines of English and mathematics, which were mandated to primarily use high school information for direct placement into transfer-level course work. Credit ESL students were not included in the original text of either bill. However, advocacy by three community college ESL faculty led to language amendments in both laws on behalf of ESL students. Further advocacy resulted in an ESL subcommittee to ensure that the needs of ESL students would still be met in the implementation of AB 705.</ab>

        <ab>As the United States population approaches a minority majority, the need to address educational inequities is intensified, especially for Latin@ students who are among the fastest growing ethnic minority group across the United States and at four-year colleges and universities. Concerns for educational equity also demand broadening participation of domestic under-represented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Informed by student-level data from six large, public, doctoral-granting, research-intensive universities located in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, we examine differences in STEM degree attainment among Latin@s at the intersections of race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status. The results support the need to target STEM intervention efforts to Latin@s by gender.</ab>

        <ab>This study investigated features of instructors' classroom discourse on the derivative with the commognitive lens. The analysis focused on how three calculus instructors addressed the derivative as a point-specific value and as a function in the beginning lessons about the derivative. The results show that (a) the instructors frequently used secant lines and the tangent line on the graph of a curve to illustrate the symbolic notation for the derivative at a point without making explicit connections between the graphical illustration and the symbolic notations, (b) they made a transition from the point-specific view of the derivative to the interval view mainly by changing the literal symbol for a point to a variable rather than addressing how the quantity that the derivative shows, changes over an interval, (c) they quantified the derivative as a number using functions with limited graphical features, and (d) they often justified the property of the derivative function with the slope of the tangent line at a point as an indication of the universality of the property. These results show that the aspects of the derivative that the past mathematicians and today's students have difficulties with are not explicitly addressed in these three classrooms. They also suggest that making explicit these aspects of the derivative through word use and visual mediators, and making clear connections between the ways that the quantities and properties of the derivative are visually mediated with symbolic, graphical, and algebraic notations would help students to understand why and how the limit component for the derivative are illustrated on graphs and expressed symbolically, and the derivative is expanded from a point to an interval, and properties of the derivative are investigated over an interval. More explicit discussions on these ideas perhaps make them more accessible to students.</ab>

        <ab>The article presents a case study of the use of a middle school mathematics teacher of peer-review activities involving rubrics to communicate mathematical resources that students may use when justifying a mathematical claim. It explores the benefits of the rubric to how students create written arguments as well as highlights the role of peer-review activities in the evaluation of students of arguments. A discussion on the importance of argumentation in a mathematical practice is offered.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, mathematics classrooms are conceptualized as heterogeneous spaces in which multiple figured worlds come into contact. The study explores how a group of high school students drew upon several figured worlds as they navigated mathe-matical discussions. Results highlight 3 major points. First, the students drew on 2 primary figured worlds: a mathematics learning figured world and a figured world of friendship and romance. Both of these figured worlds were racialized and gendered, and were actively constructed and contested by the students. Second, these figured worlds offered resources for 1 African American student, Dawn, to position herself powerfully within classroom hierarchies. Third, these acts of positioning allowed Dawn to engage in mathematical practices such as conjecturing, clarifying ideas, and providing evidence.</ab>

        <ab>Summary: This paper presents qualitative findings emergent from a participatory action research (PAR) study focused on developing service user and carer involvement in a university setting. The involvement of these experts by experience in practitioner education for health and social care, and nursing in particular, is now an international phenomenon. Adhering to the philosophy and practices of PAR, the project and the writing of this paper have been collectively produced. Data has been organised using simple thematic analysis into three broad themes accounting for different ways in which participating service users and carers obtain a sense of value from their involvement. We have titled these themes: a more positive sense of self; social and relational benefits; altruism in activism. Drawing on these participant narratives we develop an understanding of the relationship between involvement and reward that does not simply reflect value in payment.</ab>

        <ab>Nationwide, virtually all secondary students interact with British literature, a traditionally Anglo, white, male canon. Yet, this revered curriculum provides few mirrors for students from historically marginalized populations to see their own cultures reflected. In this reflective practitioner piece, the authors first illustrate how counterstorytelling-a practice emerging from critical race theory-can break open the canon. Because counterstorytelling invites, values, and projects marginalized voices, when incorporated into the secondary English classroom, the practice helps engage students with the material while developing and honing their literacy skills. Second, the authors detail a lesson demonstrating that the canon and counterstorytelling can work synergistically. Throughout the article, the authors attend to the challenges of using an equity pedagogy to teach a canon that functions as the majoritarian story of the secondary literacy classroom-and society at large. Finally, the authors offer strategies for effectively incorporating counterstorytelling into the secondary English classroom.</ab>

        <ab>Today's scientist is faced with complex problems that require interdisciplinary solutions. Consequently, tertiary science educators have had to develop and deliver interdisciplinary science courses to equip students with the skills required to solve the evolving real-world challenges of today and tomorrow. There are few reported studies of the lessons learned from designing and delivering first year compulsory interdisciplinary science subjects at regional universities. Even fewer studies assess the impact that teaching interventions within interdisciplinary courses have on studentsâ attitudes towards mathematics and technology, and mathematics anxiety. This paper discusses the feedback received from the first student cohort of a new compulsory, first year interdisciplinary science subject at a regional Australian university which resulted in curricular revisions. These revisions included a greater emphasis on the subject relevance and increased student support in tutorials. Assessment practices were also dramatically modified. The change in student attitudes and anxiety levelsa priorianda posteriorito the interventions was measured quantitatively and qualitatively. Post-intervention, female and non-mathematics major students had grown in mathematical confidence and were less anxious. It is important that positive and negative research findings are reported, so science educators can learn from one another, and can better prepare their students for the challenges they will face in bringing interdisciplinary solutions to contemporary real-world problems.</ab>

        <ab>Experienced readers of literature are more likely than novices to identify aspects of text that are salient to literary interpretation and to construct figurative meanings and thematic inferences from literary texts. This quasi-experimental study explores the hypothesis that novice readers can be supported in constructing literary interpretations by drawing on and applying everyday interpretive practices to their readings. Specifically, an everyday affect-based practice can serve as an interpretive heuristic to support the move from a local summary to a range of figurative interpretations. The affect-based interpretive heuristic involves identifying language in a literary text that a reader feels is particularly affect-laden, ascribing valence to that language, and then explaining or justifying those ascriptions. In a four-week, classroom-based instructional intervention, a 12th-grade class from a high-poverty, low-achieving, urban high school practiced this interpretive heuristic as they read literary texts. A comparative class also engaged in a unit of literary interpretation but did not use the heuristic. Analysis of a pre- and poststudy interpretive writing task and clinical think-aloud protocols from both groups showed that students receiving the intervention made gains in interpretive responses, whereas the comparison group did not. The results suggest that explicit instruction in affect-driven interpretive heuristics can support novice readers in constructing interpretive readings of literary texts.</ab>

        <ab>This paper discusses fairness and equity in assessment of mathematics. The increased importance of teachers' interpretative judgments of students' performance in high-stakes assessments and in the classroom has prompted this exploration. Following a substantial theoretical overview of the field, the issues are illustrated by two studies that took place in the context of a reformed mathematics curriculum in England. One study is of teachers' informal classroom assessment practices; the other is of their interpretation and evaluation of students' formal written mathematical texts (i.e., responses to mathematics problems). Results from both studies found that broadly similar work could be interpreted differently by different teachers. The formation of teachers' views of students and evaluation of their mathematical attainments appeared to be influenced by surface features of students' work and behavior and by individual teachers' prior expectations. We discuss and critique some approaches to improving the quality and equity of teachers' assessment. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>Numerous federal and national commissions have called for policies, funds, and initiatives aimed at expanding the nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce and education investments to create a significantly larger, more diverse talent pool of individuals who pursue technical careers. Career development professionals are poised to contribute to the equity discourse about broadening STEM participation. However, few are aware of STEM-related career development matters, career opportunities and pathways, or strategies for promoting STEM pursuits. The author summarizes STEM education and workforce trends and articulates an equity imperative for broadening and diversifying STEM participation. The author then offers a multicultural STEM-focused career development framework to encourage career development professionals' knowledge and awareness of STEM education and careers and delineates considerations for practice aimed at increasing the attainment and achievement of diverse groups in STEM fields.</ab>

        <ab>This case-study, drawing on an unanticipated theme arising from a wider study of ability-grouping in primary mathematics, documents some of the consequences of educational triage in the final year of one primary school. The paper discusses how a process of educational triage, as a response to accountability pressures, is justified by teachers on the basis of shared theories about ability and potential. Attainment gains show that some practices associated with the triaging process work for the school, pushing selected pupils to achieve the Government target for the end of primary school. However, other practices appear to coincide with reduced mathematical gains for the lowest attaining pupils and a widening of the attainment gap. This case-study examines the mechanisms behind this, focusing on resource allocation, and assumptions about learners and their potential. The paper suggests a need to create dissonance, challenging shared assumptions, such as fixed-ability, which currently support triage processes.</ab>

She suggests a few ways to support students to engage in proofs: by encouraging them to understand the existing mathematical justifications; asking them to explain how they perceive a problem; show them what makes a justification valid; emphasize explaining âwhyâ? it is so; and finally, redirecting their attention to the point of context.</ab>

        <ab>STEM, an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, is widely used in science education. There is confusion, however, as to its provenance and meaning which is potentially problematic. This study examines the purpose of STEM practice in education in England and asks if there are differences in perceptions of STEM between science and mathematics educator stakeholders. The studyâs contribution to the literature is its unusual focus on those who were responsible for making and enacting national STEM policy. A two-phase qualitative approach was followed comprising an analysis of government documentation together with semi-structured interviews with key contributors to the science and mathematics education discourse. Findings suggest that there is a disconnect between the interpretations of the science and mathematics educators with a danger-advantage dichotomy to participation in STEM being perceived by the mathematics educators. Early aims of the STEM agenda, including increasing diversity, gave way to a focus on numbers of post-16 physics and mathematics students. We conclude that if the term STEM is to continue to be used then there is a need for greater clarity about what it represents in educational terms and a wider debate about its compatibility with the aims of science education for all.</ab>

        <ab>BackgroundSchool improvement initiatives in England have focused on urban areas, which have traditionally been home to larger numbers of poor and underperforming pupils. Previous research has found that rural regions of the country have had higher overall educational attainment due to their greater affluence. However, that broad picture could be hiding under-serviced and under-performing pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. PurposeThe studyâs aim was to identify whether all pupils and all disadvantaged pupils attending geographically isolated secondary schools have different academic attainment rates compared with their peers at less isolated schools. MethodsThe isolation of a school is calculated based on the average travel time by car to its five nearest state-funded mainstream secondary schools. This was then included as an independent variable, along with variables for school demographics, prior pupil attainment and neighbourhood deprivation. ResultsDisadvantaged pupils attending more isolated schools had lower attainment rates (as measured by the percentage of students achieving grades of C or higher in English, mathematics and at least three other subjects at General Certificate of Secondary Education [GCSE] level) than pupils in less isolated schools, when controlling for school demographics and prior attainment. There was no relationship found between whole-school GCSE attainment and geographic isolation. ConclusionWhen framing the challenges of providing equitable opportunities in education, broader contexts beyond pupil characteristics, such as geographic isolation, should be taken into consideration.</ab>

        <ab>Background: An enduring question about achievement gaps is, which aspects of schools contribute most? At the early grade levels, when children spend the vast majority of their school day in a single classroom with a single teacher, school inequities that correlate with achievement gaps likely originate within the classroom. This study examined the degree to which three potential sources of classroom-based inequality contribute to reading and math achievement gaps that develop during first grade, including classroom context, access to a qualified teachers, and access to an effective teacher. The study also estimated the degree to which these effects are manifested among classrooms within the same school and between classrooms at different schools, which has implications for policy and practice. Population: A nationally representative sample of first graders from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study was used. An important feature of ECLS data is that students were administered reading and math achievement tests near the beginning and near the end of first grade. This sampling design allows for the estimation of student achievement gains during first grade that does not include the summer period, which has confounded past efforts to study achievement gaps. Research Design: Multilevel models were used to estimate classroom-specific and school-specific random effects (i.e., residuals), which are conceptualized as within- and between-school classroom effects. These random effects were then used as outcomes to estimate the degree to which within- and between-school classroom effects contribute to Black-White and Hispanic- White achievement gaps that develop during first grade. Covariates for classroom context, access to a qualified teacher, and access to an effective teacher were entered into the model hierarchically to isolate their effects on the gaps. Conclusions: Classroom inequality within and between schools contributed substantially to achievement gaps that developed during first grade. Inequality in contextual aspects of classrooms was the most prominent school-based factor, the majority of which originated from classrooms in different schools rather than classrooms in the same school. However, compared to White children attending the same school, Black children tended to be members of a classroom with more negative contextual characteristics and a less effective teacher. This within-school inequity likely stems from non-random assignment of students to teachers. Finally, Black and Hispanic children were slightly less likely to be taught by a highly qualified teacher. However, that inequity did not significantly contribute to achievement gaps.</ab>

        <ab>The NCTM's Research Committee has prepared this article as a means to raise the awareness about equity and issues surrounding equity from a research perspective as well as to support the NCTM's commitment to the Equity Principle. The committee discusses the concept of equity from three perspectives: as a subject of research, as a âcritical lensâ with which to examine research, and as a cross-disciplinary theme. Equity issues offer a unique opportunity to unite research and practice within mathematics education and across other disciplines. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>This study focuses on quantifying the quality of mathematics teaching in 183 randomly selected sixth grade classrooms: 100 from the North West province of South Africa and 83 from South East Botswana. The teaching quality is measured by coding videotaped lessons for three different components: mathematical proficiency, level of cognitive demand, and observed teacher knowledge. Results suggest that the overall teaching quality is about the same in both regions. Some variation was observed at the level of each component. For example, in the South Africa sample the students engage more in tasks that just involve 'memorization' and less in tasks that involve 'procedures without connections' in comparison with the Botswana students. Teachers in Botswana implement the official curriculum more faithfully than do those in North West. In both countries most of the learners engaged only in low-level tasks (very little activity involved 'procedures with connections') and teachers demonstrated a lack of knowledge about how to integrate mathematical content with effective pedagogical techniques.</ab>

        <ab>This article argues that children represent one vanguard of an emergent shift in Western subjectivity, and that adult-child dialogue, especially in the context of schooling, is a key locus for the epistemological change that implies. Following Herbert Marcuse's invocation of a 'new sensibility', the author argues that the evolutionary phenomenon of neoteny-the long formative period of human childhood and the pedomorphic character of humans across the life cycle-makes of the adult-collective of school a primary site for the reconstruction of belief. After exploring child-adult dialogue more broadly as a form of dialectical interaction between what Dewey called 'impulse' and 'habit', three key dimensions of dialogic schooling are identified, all of which are grounded in a fourth: the form of dialogical group discourse called community of philosophical inquiry ( CPI), which is based on the problematisation and reconstruction of concepts through critical argumentation. As a discourse-model, CPI grounds practice in all of the dialogic school's emergent curricular spaces, whether science, mathematics, literature, art, or philosophy. Second, it opens a functional space for shared decision-making and collaborative governance, making of school an exemplary model of direct democracy. Finally, CPI as a site for critical interrogation of concepts encountered in the curriculum (e.g. 'alive', 'justice', 'system', 'biosphere') and as a site for democratic governance leads naturally to expression in activist projects that model an emergent 'new reality principle' through concrete solutions to practical problems on local and global levels.</ab>

        <ab>The writer argues that students who are English language learners (ELLs) can and must be provided with access to rich mathematical content.  Teachers should value the resources, both linguistic and otherwise, that students bring to class and should utilize them for modeling good mathematics practices and building on students' contributions.  While working with ELLs, it is not sufficient to focus solely on technical vocabulary associated with mathematics.  Rather, classes need to include student involvement in classroom discussions, group work, and problem solving sessions.  The mathematics classroom should not be separate from students' home culture or background, and teachers should strive to acknowledge these and make use of them in the classroom.</ab>

        <ab>This qualitative study surveyed 102 differential-equations students in order to investigate how students participating in writing projects in university-level mathematics courses perceive the benefits of writing in the mathematics classroom. Based on previous literature on writing in mathematics, students were asked specifically about the benefits of writing projects as a means to explore practical uses of mathematics, deepen content knowledge, and strengthen communication. Student responses indicated an awareness of these benefits, supporting justifications commonly cited by instructors assigning writing projects. Open-ended survey responses highlighted additional themes which students associated with writing in mathematics, including using software programs and technology, working in groups, and stimulating interest in mathematics. This study provides student feedback to support the use of writing projects in mathematics, as well as student input, which can be utilized to strengthen the impact of writing projects in mathematics.</ab>

        <ab>In line with international trends, the new South African mathematics curriculum implores mathematics educators to realize a pedagogy in their classrooms that is more practical, activity-oriented, and connected to their learners' lives. Drawing on data from a larger study that explores theory-practice relations in mathematics education, this paper shows how such progressive practices, when interpreted with respect to the teaching of measurement which required learners to use different measuring instruments for measuring the school grounds in learning about length and perimeter, were found to be deeply gendered. In two different contexts of an âAfricanâ township school and a predominantly âIndianâ suburban school, girls in a grade 6 mathematics classroom faced direct sexism as they struggled to take the opportunity to participate in the activity and learn how to measure - an important mathematical competence and everyday knowledge and skill. The article analyses the data with reference to the human rights imperatives of the new national curricula and approaches to addressing disadvantage and discrimination for girls in mathematics classrooms.

        <ab>This collaborative research, which ran for more than 15 months, focuses on some challenges that science and technology teachers face as they try to integrate class-workshops to science education in the context of a curricular reform in Quebec. This situation justified the establishment of a collaborative effort between several stakeholders from the school, and especially between two reflective practitioners who modeled, with the research team, two teaching and evaluating learning situations (TLS) that aimed to integrate with their peers a technological design approach to science education, engaging in five-day teacher training sessions. Following these sessions, some participating teachers agreed to implement the TLS in their classes and welcomed members of the research team to do some co-teaching. We were able to document conditions favouring and as well as limiting the motivation of teachers to integrate technology in the study of wind turbines and electronics with students with the aim of better contextualizing the scientific and technological concepts of the program.</ab>

        <ab>The science of broadening participation explains how science thrives with appropriate frameworks for addressing complex issues. This article presents a developmental framework for equitable STEM scholar development, access, and opportunity. Few issues in academia are more complex than ensuring all scholars can thrive without unwarranted obstacles of intentional disruption or benign indifference. The Thrive Mosaic developmental framework coalesces the best elements of a scholarâs networks to support scholar development, advocacy, and self-care, while also working to forestall systemic marginalization and obstructionist practices. The framework uses a systems thinking approach where aspects of the âecology of academiaâ important to scholar success are conceptualized as systems that can be adapted to benefit the scholar and support scholar activism. The goal is to mitigate environmental internal and external factors that impede scholar success. Thrive Mosaic is both a resource and a tool for realizing scholar thriving, particularly within privileged and noncollegial environments.</ab>

        <ab>This article reports on a two-year qualitative, practitioner-research study of teaching and learning for social justice. The site was my middle-school mathematics classroom in a Chicago public school in a Latino/a community. A major pedagogical goal was to create conditions for students to develop agency, a sense of themselves as subjects in the world. My research suggests that students learned mathematics and began to develop sociopolitical awareness and see themselves as possible actors in society through using mathematics to understand social injustices. This research contributes to our understanding of how to create opportunities for students to develop agency in K-12 mathematics classrooms, and may also contribute to our knowledge of developing agency in any subject area.

        <ab>If we work every day as Kâ12 art + design teachers, arts coordinators, museum professionals, or university teacher educators, why should science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM) matter? STEAM matters because we are more than just instructors of art and art education. While most of our students year in and year out will not become professional artists, we are nevertheless arguably the primary teachers of creativity our students will ever have throughout their education. Fundamentally, our job is to instigate and foster arts practice and design thinking as a means for individual learning, social responsibility, and creative problem solvingâmediating ideas and materials toward meaningful and enduring solutions. The art studio is one of the very few spaces in school or society where widely divergent outcomes are encouraged and never-before-imagined design solutions are valued. As an acronym for educational imagination, STEAM promises the enhancement of divergent outcomes emerging from the art + design studio by immersing students in a diversity of knowledge bases across contributing domains of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math. Moreover, one of the best things about STEAM education is that you do not have to figure out how to invent the STEAM engine for innovation alone. Diverse collaborations and resources equip STEAM classrooms for locomotion.</ab>

        <ab>The entire education community must show commitment to the academic achievement and excellence of all students if equity in mathematics and science is to be achieved.  Educators need, therefore, to direct their gaze away from the achievement gap and toward the inequities inherent in the limited access to quality science and mathematics education that has characterized education for students of color in the U.S.  Teachers, in particular, should adopt philosophies and practices reflecting their wish to prepare students for participation in a 21st-century democracy, in a commitment that needs to transcend rhetoric and slogans to promote action facilitating the accomplishment of what teachers say they are committed to.</ab>

        <ab>Games, play, and learning have a long and embedded history that outdates digital games by many years. However, video games, computing, and technology have significant and historically documented diversity issues, which privilege whites and males as content producers, computing and gaming experts, and STEM learners and employees. Many aspects of culture and formal education reinforce these dynamics, from who is supported to play to who comes to produce online content for leisure or employment. However, both supportive communities and culturally responsive pedagogies offer evidence of and strategies for equitable design and learning. Herein the author presents research demonstrating that learning is culturally situated in game playing and making, and further presents strategies for designing or integrating games for equitable and inclusive learning.</ab>

        <ab>This article examines the social nature of teachersï¿½ conceptions by showing how teachers frame the ï¿½mismatchï¿½ of studentsï¿½ perceived abilities and the intended school curriculum through conversational category systems. This study compares the conversations of 2 groups of high school mathematics teachers addressing the Mismatch Problem when implementing equity-geared reforms. Although East High teachers challenged conceptions that were not aligned with a reform, South High teachers reworked a reform mandate to align with their existing conceptions. This research found that the teachersï¿½conversational category systems modeled problems of practice; communicated assumptions about students, subject, and teaching; and were ultimately reflected in the curriculum. Because East High teachers supported greater numbers of studentsï¿½ success in advanced mathematics, this study considers the relation between teachersï¿½ understandings of student learning and the success of equity-geared math reforms. In addition, this study contributes to the understanding of how teacher conceptions of students are negotiated and reified in context, specifically through interactions with colleagues and experiences with school reform.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: During asynchronous, online mathematics discussions, new ideas and justifications (knowledge content) and evaluations and invitations to participate (social metacognition) can influence the likelihood of a correct, new idea (CNI) in the current message. Using statistical discourse analysis, we modeled 894 messages by 183 participants on 60 high school mathematics topics on a mathematics problem solving website not connected to any class or school. Results showed that CNIs, justifications, and social metacognition (correct evaluations and questions) in recent messages increased the likelihood of a CNI in the current message. Meanwhile, more experienced participants (who had posted more messages on the website) had more CNIs, and participants who initiated topics had fewer CNIs. Applied to practice, these results suggest that teachers can facilitate studentsâ creation of CNIs by encouraging them to justify their ideas, evaluate one anotherâs ideas carefully, and ask questions during online mathematics discussions.</ab>

        <ab>Preparing children to be successful in mathematics begins with what they learn before they reach 1st grade. Math knowledge in prekindergarten and kindergarten predicts school achievement in math and in other topics, such as reading. Indeed, early math knowledge is one of the strongest predictors of math grades in high school, high school graduation, and college entry. But children enter kindergarten with a huge range of numerical knowledge and skills. So early educators must be attentive to practices that will aid in closing the gaps in learning. They can attend to this by following the guidance outlined in the National Research Councilâs report, Mathematics Learning in Early Childhood: Paths Toward Excellence and Equity, which identified math concepts that young children can and should learn. Especially important are childrenâs competence with quantity and number, as well as geometry and spatial reasoning. The NRCâs research summary and recommendations helped guide the Common Core State Standards in mathematics for kindergarten through 2nd grade.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, we present, analyse and critique an episode from a secondary school lesson involving an introduction to the definition of the scalar product. Although the teacher attempted to be explicit about the difference between a definition and a theorem, emphasizing that a definition was just an arbitrary assumption, a student rejected the teacher's definition in favour of his own alternative. With reference to this particular case, we seek to explore some ways in which teachers can introduce mathematical definitions to students so as to support, rather than attempt to circumvent, their mathematical sense making. In this regard, we believe that it is important to develop learning opportunities for students which help them to gain some appreciation of important structural and historical reasons that underpin the definitional choices made.</ab>

        <ab>ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Schools have increasing responsibility to address healthy eating, but physical barriers influence their ability to adopt and sustain recommended strategies. We took advantage of a natural experiment to investigate the role of the physical environment in shaping healthy eating attitudes and practices among school staff members. METHODS A school district consolidated its elementary schools and incorporated architectural features to support healthy eating into a building renovation. Surveys along with structured, in-depth interviews were administered prior to and at 12 months postoccupancy. Paired t-tests and McNemar's tests were used to analyze changes in survey indices and interview data were coded for themes. RESULTS The school implemented new policies and programs, including staff wellness activities. There was a significant decrease in the percent of teachers with a high-fat diet (from 73.68% to 57.14%, p &lt; .05). Many physical barriers were removed but new challenges emerged, and staff varied in their awareness and comfort with using the new healthy eating features. CONCLUSIONS We found promising evidence that school architecture can support a school to address healthy eating. To enhance influence of the physical environment, more research is merited to test complementary strategies such as improving ownership of space and increasing self-efficacy to manage space.</ab>

        <ab>We analyzed the collaborative process of mathematics and vocational-technical education (VTE) instructors in eight sites, located across the United States, as they developed one authentic, integrated mathematics curriculum unit. Over two years, we collected data on teachers' viewpoints on instruction, integration, and mathematics/VTE reforms. Site visits were conducted to gather additional information on teachers' views, teaching practices, collaboration process, school context, and quality of curriculum units. We found that although the quality of the units varied, the overall analysis suggested that is it is possible for interdisciplinary teams of teachers to create high quality integrated mathematics curriculum units if certain conditions are met. Having support from the school's community, meeting regularly with all the team members, focusing conversations toward student understanding, writing tasks that promote conceptual and integrated understanding of the concepts, and writing the unit together with reflective thought, all seemed to be critical elements in successful integrated unit writing.

        <ab>Background/Context: Standard English functions as a dominant language in the English-speaking Caribbean context despite the bidialectal, bilingual, and multilingual nature of countries. Notwithstanding, Caribbean non-Standard English-speaking students continue to be administered literacy assessments that do not take into account their nonstandardized English language use. This practice inadvertently reinforces assumptions that privilege Standard English as a language of assessment (Canagarajah, 2006b; Shohamy, 2006) and that devalue certain World Englishes (Canagarajah, 2006a) in academia. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: In this study, we examined the way in which 3,184 15-year-old 9th and 10th grade Trinidadian bidialectal adolescent youth self-identified linguistically on the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) literacy assessment and explored their reading, math, and science literacy performance based on their selfidentification as native English and non-native English speaking students. Population/Participants/Subjects: The population included 3,184 15-year-old students, 52.3% (n = 1,666) of whom were girls and 47.7% (n = 1,518) of whom were boys. Of this population, 28.5% (n = 909) were in Grade 9 while the rest were in Grade 10 (n = 2,275); 89.7% (n = 2,856) were enrolled in public schools and 10.3% (n = 327) were enrolled in private schools; and across these groups, 97.3% (n = 3,098) identified English (i.e., Standard English) while 2.7% (n = 86) identified a language other than Standard English as their "native" language (i.e., non-Standard English). Research Design: The statistical results in our study were based on secondary analysis of a survey-based nationally representative sample of 15-year-old students from Trinidad and Tobago. We used analysis of covariance in order to control for demographic differences and used hierarchical linear modeling to verify the robustness of our empirical findings. Findings: The majority of students self-identified as [Standard] English speakers despite the predominant use of nonstandardized Englishes in their country. Findings showed large and significant differences between "self-identifying native" and "self-identifying non-native" speakers of English, with higher mean scores for the former group in all three assessed areas of literacy as measured in English. Self-identifying native English speakers performed significantly below the PISA 2009 OECD mean of 500 and reflected a high degree of volatility in performance. These differences persisted even after controlling for important student demographic differences such as grade, gender, school type, and indicators of socioeconomic and cultural status. Conclusions/Recommendations: The study serves to justify the need for closer attention to the pervasive role of colonialism in the dominance of Standard English in multilingual testing (Shohamy, 2006), highlights the need for attention to bidialectal students' performativity in World Englishes that challenge normative Standard English literacy proficiency (Canagarajah, 2006a), and requires that assumptions steeped in colonialism that underlie Standard English literacy testing on the PISA international measure be revisited if bidialectal adolescent learners are to be accurately represented on these measures in much the same manner as their monolingual and Standard English speaking counterparts.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this paper is initially to present findings which identify components of the practices of teachers acting as assessors of students' mathematics in the normal course of classroom work.  At an informal level such practice is found to be complex and intimately related to every aspect of teaching and learning.  It is found that even teachers who have undergone some assessment training may underestimate the role of interpretation of evidence, and questions about equity in the uses of teachers' judgements are raised in relation to awareness and practice.  It is suggested that more care needs to be taken over the formation and use of âprofessional judgementsâ within systems of assessment.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>The current status of-at-risk and adjudicated youth with behavioral challenges provides a context for addressing needed future directions for research and practice in fields that impact this population. This context includes the myriad characteristics and complex needs of these youth, the programs and services currently available in communities and secure settings, and youth outcomes following incarceration. Recent and emerging national, state, and local initiatives and the benefits that have been realized or are anticipated from their application are presented. The challenges to achieving and sustaining these systems changes are then discussed. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research and practice, based on the issues raised in this special issue and elsewhere.</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on the application of Racial and Ethnic Minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (REM STEM) Model to determine the impact of future research, policy, and practice on STEM education. It states that the factors that influence the success of racial and ethnic minority in STEM education circuit were illustrated by REM STEM Model. It says that educational inequities, culturally relevant curricula, and early exposure of students to STEM careers are among the factors that influence the racial and ethnic minority students' success in STEM education. It adds that evidence on the types of parental engagement that enhance students' success in STEM is needed to help teachers to know the appropriate ways of dealing with minority students and parents.</ab>

        <ab>Rational and operationalized views of science and what it means for teachers and students to know and enact legitimate science practices have dominated science education research for many decades (Fusco and Barton in J Res Sci Teach 38(3):337-354, 2001. doi:). Michalinos Zembylas challenges historically prevalent dichotomies of mind/body, reason/emotion, and emotion/affect, calling researchers and educators to move beyond the Cartesian dualisms, which have perpetuated a myth of scientific objectivity devoid of bias, subjectivity and emotions. Zembylas (Crit Stud Teach Learn 1(1):1-21, 2013. doi:) contends that the role of emotions and affect are best understood as relational and entangled in epistemological, cultural, and historical contexts of education, which represent contested sites of control and resistance. We argue that Zembylas' work is pivotal since 'theoretical frames of reference for doing research in science education...[and] what constitutes knowledge and being within a particular frame' carry material bearings over the enactments of science teaching and learning (Kyle in J Res Sci Teach 31:695-696, 1994, p. 321. doi:). In this paper, we hold cogen dialogue about how re-thinking notions of emotion and affect affords us, both science educators and researchers, to re-envision science education beyond cognitive and social frames. The framing of our dialogue as cogen builds on Wolff-Michael Roth and Kenneth Tobin's (At the elbows of another: learning to teach through coteaching. Peter Lang Publishing, New York, 2002) notion of cogenerative dialogue. Holding cogen is an invitation to an openly dialogic and safe area, which serves as a space for a dialogic inquiry that includes radical listening of situated knowledges and learning from similarities as well as differences of experiences (Tobin in Cult Stud Sci Educ, in review, 2015). From our situated experiences reforms, colleges of education, schools, and curriculum place not enough emphasis on affective and bodily dimensions of teaching and learning. Instead, the privilege seems to be given to reason, evidence, and rationalities, which continue to reinforce dominant ways of knowing and experiencing. The separation of mind and body, reason and emotion, effect and affect in teaching and research might bear unintended and negative consequences for many children and teachers who are engaged in bodily and affective forms of learning science. In this forum we wish to expand on the discussion to consider the interdependent nature of learning, experience, and affect by drawing on our work with science teachers and culturally and linguistically diverse students, juxtaposed alongside Zembylas' reflections, to further theorize the affective turn in science education.</ab>

        <ab>Content-area literacy involves the use of research-based learning strategies that help students effectively and efficiently gain content knowledge. Its use is fundamental to all content areas, not just to those that rely heavily on printed materials. One of the major goals of content-area instruction is to produce critical thinkers and problem solvers, and content-area literacy is a tool that teachers use to help students achieve this goal. Through this author's teaching experiences, she (Ming) learned about literacy strategies that are useful in art, mathematics, music, and physical education. Thus, in this article, she discusses the importance of using literacy in content-area instruction. Specifically, she talks about how literacy strengthens studentsâ language arts skills, shares 10 content-area literacy strategies that can be integrated into the four content areas, and provides specific examples of what they would look like in each area.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines how the teaching of world religious at Catholic Christians institutions can contribute to teaching justice and teaching justly. The paper compares central issues engaged by History of Religious as a discipline with those addressed within the Jesuit tradition of higher education as it developed in the wake of the Second Vatican Council. While many scholars have argued that the academic study of religion and theology are premised upon irreconcilably opposed paradigms of teaching and scholarship, this paper argues that a creative combination of the two disciplines can create a crucial space for reconsidering justice within the contemporary classroom at Catholic Christian colleges that embrace the Jesuit tradition of higher education.</ab>

        <ab>The writer examines inquisitional variants of whiteness theory using tools of analysis borrowed from critical realism.  She argues that whiteness theorists such as Barbara Applebaum, which are referred to as âA-type,â perform social experiments that should be subject to ethical research protocols and these theoreticians, therefore, should consider the practical implications of their work.  Furthermore, she demonstrates that A-type whiteness theory is ontologically and epistemically flawed, which yields ethically suspect practice.</ab>

        <ab>In this response to Foundations for Success:  The Final Report of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel (2008), the authors argue that the Panel's assumption that only experimental research studies can produce scientific evidence limits the power of the Panel's recommendations to improve mathematics teaching and learning.  The authors first discuss the theoretical underpinnings, potential contributions, and limitations of experimental studies.  Against this background, they focus on three issues that are central to improving mathematics learning and teaching, those of equity, the nature and content of textbooks, and graduate education.  In doing so, the authors illustrate the limitations of developing implications for policy and practice by relying exclusively on research conducted using a single methodology.

        <ab>Part of a special issue on building an infrastructure for equity in mathematics education.  The writer discusses J. Weissglass's four points for building an infrastructure for equity in mathematics education in the context of the story of a sixth-grade African-American male student who was not selected to take a mathematics placement test to gain entry into an upper-level prealgebra mathematics course, despite performing well in mathematics throughout his previous schooling.  These points relate to a theoretical foundation, support structures and processes, increased understanding of how bias and prejudice affect teaching and learning, and increased leadership capacity of educators to develop and advance a strategy for identifying and eliminating inequitable practices and policies in their institutions.  The writer also provides brief summaries of the articles in the special issue, all of which offer a context toward Weissglass' four points for equity in mathematics education.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reports a study on retention of differential and integral calculus concepts of a second-year student of physical chemistry at a Danish university. The focus was on what knowledge the student retained 14 months after the course and on what effect beliefs about mathematics had on the retention. We argue that if a student can quickly reconstruct the knowledge, given a few hints, this is just as good as retention. The study was conducted using a mixed method approach investigating studentsâ knowledge in three worlds of mathematics. The results showed that the student had a very low retention of concepts, even after hints. However, after completing the calculus course, the student had successfully used calculus in a physical chemistry study programme. Hence, using calculus in new contexts does not in itself strengthen the original calculus learnt; they appeared as disjoint bodies of knowledge.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, we explore how Jacques RanciÃ¨re's (The ignorant schoolmaster: five lessons in intellectual emancipation. Stanford University Press, Stanford, 1991) notions of radical equality and dissensus reveal horizons for activism and sociopolitical engagement in science education theory, research, and practice. Drawing on Rochelle GutiÃ©rrez' (J Res Math Educ 44(1):37-68, 2013a. doi:; J Urban Math Educ 6(2):7-19, b) 'sociopolitical turn' for mathematics education, we identify how the field of science education can/is turning from more traditional notions of equity, achievement and access toward issues of systemic oppression, identity and power. Building on the conversation initiated by Lorraine Otoide who draws from French philosopher Jacques RanciÃ¨re to experiment with a pedagogy of radical equality, we posit that a sociopolitical turn in science education is not only imminent, but necessary to meet twenty-first century crises.</ab>

        <ab>This study investigated the influence of regular structured writing about problem solving on college algebra students' locus of control, flexibility of articulation, and accuracy in responding to written problem tasks. The writing assignments, acronym PSOLVE, provided students a framework for expressing their thoughts about mathematical actions, processes, structures, and language. Given that augmenting traditional college algebra classes with the PSOLVE writing assignments resulted in statistically significantly higher scores on routine problems on the common posttest (p &lt; 0.05), we examined PSOLVE and non-PSOLVE students' written mathematical justifications in response to mildly non-routine short-answer items on the same posttest. PSOLVE students posttest explanations were clear and mathematically consistent. The PSOLVE writing assignment appears to be a useful support for growth of declarative and procedural knowledge as well as an effective conduit for the instructor to gain insight into students' thinking. We discuss potentional benefits of the PSOLVE augmentation for the development of research and practice in college mathematics teaching. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>ABSTRACT Federal education policy reports in science and mathematics education have treated Students of Color consistently over the past two decades, addressing the underrepresentation of minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields with little regard to actual issues of race and ethnicity. We examine how 17 federal education policy briefs focusing on STEM have addressed issues of equity with regard to Students of Color. We use a critical race theory lens to interpret and understand our findings. We find that the documents used broadly defined, racially essentializing terms; that discourse surrounding race fluctuated, perhaps cyclically, over time; and that arguments for inclusive STEM education were made predominantly from a one-sided economic perspective, favoring the owners and operators of STEM enterprises.</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on the education system in Amish, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania which seems to be plain and simple with no exposure to technology and official school-leaving age of 14 as compared to 16 in other U.S. schools. Topics discussed include teachers receiving training of just three days, lack of importance given to maths in the system, and the satisfaction of girl in becoming a teacher although low paid.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast the efforts of two universities to address the issue of providing computer forensics students with the opportunity to get involved in the practical aspects of forensic search and seizure procedures. The paper discusses the approaches undertaken by the University of Sunderland and the University of South Wales (Glamorgan) to give the students the opportunity to process a case from the crime scene through to the court room. In order to do this both institutions adopted a problem-based learning (PBL) approach â to reflect real-world solutions and encourage students to work in groups to seek further knowledge and understanding of the various processes and procedures â in particular the steps around search and seizure of digital evidence from a crime scene. The PBL activities at Sunderland and Glamorgan were designed in order to help the students understand the processes of digital crime scene analysis and search and seizure procedures and to give them the opportunity to put into practice their digital forensics techniques. Both exercises were designed to give the opportunity to solve realistic problems using PBL, and to illustrate the inter-relationships between science, technology and human activity as it applies to digital forensics, forensic science and the criminal justice system. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the exercises considering the impact they have had on student understanding and learning. Consideration is given to how the PBL activities can be disseminated and/or transferred to the wider community.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the understanding of infinity in children, teachers and primary teacher students. It focuses on a number of difficulties that people cope with when dealing with problems related to infinity such as its abstract nature, understanding of infinity as an ongoing process which never ends, understanding of infinity as a set of an infinite number of elements and understanding of well-known paradoxes. In the empirical section of the article, a study is described that was conducted at the Faculty of Education, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. It encompassed 93 third-year students of the Primary Teacher Education study programme with the aim of researching their understanding of the concept of infinity. The focus was on finding out how primary teacher students who received no in-depth instruction on abstract mathematical content understand different types of infinity: infinitely large, infinitely many and infinitely close, what argumentation they provide for their answers to problems on infinity and what their basic misunderstandings about infinity are. The results show that the respondents' understanding of infinity depends on the type of the task and on the context of the task. The respondents' justifications for the solutions are based both on actual and on potential infinity. When solving tasks of the types 'infinitely large' and 'infinitely many', they provide justifications based on actual infinity. When solving tasks of the type 'infinitely close', they use arguments based on potential infinity. We conclude that when they feel unsure of themselves, they resort to their primary method of dealing with infinity, that is, to potential infinity.</ab>

        <ab>The program of research on reading sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is one important source of information for practitioners choosing best practices for early literacy instruction.  On the basis of evidence from both normal and disabled readers, this research indicates that multiple factors are critical to early literacy success and that phonological knowledge and skill is one such element.  The utility of this body of research was called into question by Allington and Woodside-Jiron in a November 1999 Educational Researcher article titled âThe Politics of Literacy Teaching:  How âResearchâ Shaped Educational Policy.â  This response to that article is written to examine policymaking activities that are misrepresented, to correct mistakes made by Allington and Woodside-Jiron about the range and utility of NICHD research, to correct possible misperceptions of the NICHD-supported research effort that might arise in the minds of those who read the Allington and Woodside-Jiron article, and to present new evidence that clarifies the utility of much of this research.

        <ab>There has been much research and discussion on the principles of standards-based grading, and there is a growing consensus of best practice. Even so, the actual process of implementing standards-based grading at a school or district level can be a significant challenge. There are very practical questions that remain unclear, such as how the grades should be calculated. Common methods include a simple average, averaging only the more recent scores, mathematical models of growth over time, and basic teacher judgment. It is difficult to choose a single method that is justifiable in all circumstances. This article proposes a new method, the history-adjusted true score, that can be applied in a wide variety of situations. A rigorous method of evaluating each grading method is also described.</ab>

        <ab>Research about lesson study and other forms of collaborative, practice-based professional development has tended to focus on identifying structures that support teacher learning. This study builds on this work by examining preservice elementary teachers' efforts to conduct lesson studies in mathematics. Analysis showed that the structures of the lesson study project supported some groups in developing mathematical and equity lenses for looking at teaching; however, the use of these lenses simultaneously led to productive and problematic learning. This finding suggests that future research focus on challenges present in collaborative, practice-based work even when productive structures are in place.  Copyright (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.</ab>

        <ab>The culture of the young may, in fact, be a harbinger enticing us to follow a pathway from which will emerge the reconceptualized educational practices of this new century. The culture of those older will, no doubt, strive to maintain the more golden aspects of their now historical learning experiences. One of the tasks of all educators, but certainly distance educators, is to negotiate the bridge between, so as to meld the best of the collective past, however one defines it, within the pedagogical framework of the future. Athabasca University has undertaken a remedial mathematics project which attempts to do just that. This is an online learning environment which is moving from inter-active to inter-personal, from digital text to digital dialogue, and which is morphing the traditional "student role" into a more engaging "self-organizing instructor" role - all within an "e-classroom" setting founded upon traditional principles, but laid out using modern technologies.</ab>

        <ab>The current study used a single-case design to examine two performance feedback conditions varying in intensity on the frequency of naturalistic math instruction in preschool classrooms during non-instructional times (transition, lunch, free play). Three Head Start teachers received professional development that combined information on four math-oriented milieu teaching strategies (incidental teaching, time delay, mand model, and model), milieu teaching scripts, and goal setting. Teachers then received a feedback package of relatively higher intensity associated with a performance criterion followed by lower-intensity, continued support feedback package. Teachers increased the use of math-oriented milieu teaching strategies and positive attention across intervention conditions. In addition, two of the three teachers evidenced generalization of milieu teaching strategies across contexts and content areas. Results are discussed in terms of conceptualizations of intervention intensity and implications for practice, limitations, and future directions.</ab>

We discuss levels of language development appropriate for the mathematics classroom, issues related to mathematical definitions, implied meanings in many mathematics concepts, and the importance of justification. We suggest that mathematical literacy should be an essential and regular component in the mathematics classroom.</ab>

        <ab>Background/Context: Cuba's education system has been the focus of academic study by researchers on and off the island who frequently cite the comparative success of Cuban students on measures such as the UNESCO math and language assessments. Few studies, however, consider the significance of race within Cuban education generally or the home-school relationship in particular. Indeed, there has been no empirical work made available on these topics for nearly a decade. Significant sociopolitical changes are underway in Cuba, with implications for the role of the state in the cultural life of the nation. Education is a key transmission point between the state and its people, with teachers as frontline cultural workers. Purpose: This article examines the way Cuban teachers address racism in their professional practice, with a specific focus on teacher home visits to address racism with parents/guardians. The author analyzes the relationship between Cuban teachers and the families of students they teach (an under-researched form of teacher practice in an under-researched context). Little is known about teachers reaching and teaching parents directly about issues such as racism. Further, there is limited research on the ways in which understanding of citizenship and professional responsibility impact teachers' work and pedagogy in their interactions with parents. Setting: Havana, Cuba. Participants: All interviewees were teachers from downtown Havana. Twenty-two male and 23 female teachers participated. Fifteen of the teachers were Mestizo (of mixed race), one was Chinese-Cuban, 21 were Afro-Cuban, and eight were White. Survey participants were drawn from across Havana's 15 boroughs. Among respondents, 67.4% were female and 32.6% were male. As far as race, 57.8% identified as Mestizo, 18.9% identified as Afro-Cuban, 22% identified as White, and 1.3% identified as Chinese. Research Design: This is a mixed-method study using qualitative interviews (N=45 participants), and a quantitative survey (N=150 respondents). Conclusions/Recommendations: Teachers regularly enter the homes of parents in an effort to promote diversity and to counter perceived racism among parents/guardians. The fact that teachers have the authority and sense of entitlement to do so points to possibilities for a significant retooling of the ecology systems framework. Many teachers undertake this work with parents/guardians just as they would when addressing student academic performance. This race-work is supported by state-generated social capital that, in Cuba, embeds conceptions of race within a larger public context, as opposed to treating race as a private matter to be subjectively and privately understood. As quasi-curriculum, antiracism is something everyone is expected to learn. This suggests that a careful consideration of the way concepts of nation, citizenship, and professional responsibility inform teacher preparation and practice in Cuba may deepen our understanding of teachers' race-work in North American contexts.</ab>

        <ab>A study investigated language about children in the discourse of mathematics education through the metaphor of children's learning as travel along a physical path.  This metaphor supports talking and thinking about children in hierarchical ways.  Several texts in U.S. mathematics education, including conversation in an elementary classroom, a university mathematics method classroom, mathematics textbooks, and standards documents, were examined.  Findings showed that the dominance of the metaphor provides a new challenge for teachers concerned with equity:  that of analyzing their own language and practices for hierarchical language.</ab>

        <ab>The effects of a mathematical problem-solving intervention on students' problem-solving performance and math achievement were measured in a randomized control trial with 1,059 7th-grade students. The intervention, Solve It!, is a research-based cognitive strategy instructional intervention that was shown to improve the problem-solving performance of 8th-grade students with and without learning disabilities (LD). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the effectiveness of me intervention could be replicated with younger students. Forty middle schools in a large urban school district were included in the study, with one 7th-grade math teacher participating at each school (after attrition, n = 34). Solve It! was implemented by the teachers in their inclusive math classrooms. Problem-solving performance was assessed using curriculum-based math problem-solving measures, which were administered as a pretest and then monthly over the course of the 8-month intervention. Students who received the intervention (n = 644) embedded in the district curriculum showed a significantly greater rate of growth on the curriculum-based measures than students in the comparison group (n = 415) who received the district curriculum only. Results of the Bayesian analyses indicated that the intervention effect was somewhat stronger for low-achieving students than for average-achieving students. Overall, findings from the present study as well as the previous study with 8th-grade students indicate that the intervention was effective across ability groups and is an appropriate program to use in inclusive classrooms with students of varying math ability.</ab>

        <ab>We critique the "college for all" discourse by unveiling its relationship to the politics of education, the broader economic and political contexts, and the class and race structures embedded in society and schooling, including higher education. We analyze the current and future labor markets to demonstrate the ways that the "college for all" discourse overstates the need for math and science knowledge and skills within the workforce, and we analyze the debt burdens associated with college attendance and completion to demonstrate that the promised benefits of "college for all" are often illusory for low-income, racially, culturally, and linguistically diverse students. Thus, we argue that "college for all"-just like "no child left behind" and the "race to the top"-functions as an ideological velvet to soften education policy talk, talk that actually carries big sticks that punish the very students proclaimed to be the beneficiaries of the proposed changes in schooling. The results of schooling practices articulated by the "college for all" discourse are (a) the reinforcement of material barriers to the stated aims of educational access and equity, and (b) the fortification of the class and race status quo. We examine the ways that the transformation of schooling must be linked to the establishment of just social, economic, and political institutions, and to the formation of a citizenry prepared to engage in the struggles for these institutions.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes the mechanism used to gain insights into the state of the art of mathematics instruction in a large urban district in order to design meaningful professional development for the teachers in the district. Surveys of close to 2,000 elementary, middle school, and high school students were collected in order to assess the instructional practices used in mathematics classes across the district. Students were questioned about the frequency of use of various instructional practices that support the meaningful learning of mathematics. These included practices such as problem solving, use of calculators and computers, group work homework, discussions, and projects, among others. Responses were analyzed and comparisons were drawn between elementary and middle school students' responses and between middle school and high school responses. Finally, fifth-grade student responses were compared to those of their teachers. Student responses indicated that they had fewer inquiry-based experiences, fewer student-to-student interactions, and fewer opportunities to defend their answers and justify their thinking as they moved from elementary to middle school to high school. In the elementary grades students reported an overemphasis on the use of memorization of facts and procedures and sparse use of calculators. Results were interpreted and specific directions for professional development, as reported in this paper, were drawn from these data. The paper illustrates how student surveys can inform the design of professional development experiences for the teachers in a district. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

A study examined the role of home and school knowledge in the numeracy practices and mathematical identities of four children enrolled in Head Start programs.  Results revealed how social practices from home often shaped children's use of school-like materials.  Moreover, the ways in which teachers and parents recognized and responded to children's numeracy practices shaped children's numeracy identities and character.  Other results and implications of the study are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>The study investigated the relationship between mathematics anxiety and mathematics teacher efficacy among elementary preservice teachers. Participants included 28 elementary preservice teachers at a mid-size university in the southeastern United States who had just completed a mathematics methods course. Data sources included the Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale, Mathematics Teaching Efficacy Beliefs Instrument, and clinical interviews. Findings revealed a significant, moderate negative relationship between mathematics anxiety and mathematics teacher efficacy (r = -.440, p &lt; .05). In general, the preservice teachers with the low -est degrees of mathematics anxiety had the highest levels of mathematics teacher efficacy. The interviews indicated that efficaciousness toward mathematics teaching practices, descriptions of mathematics, and basis for mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs were associated with mathematics anxiety.

        <ab>Students who are deaf or hard of hearing are a low-incidence population with diverse linguistic characteristics and levels of academic achievement. This article presents findings on teacher recommendations of assessment practices for students who are deaf or hard of hearing. A total of 372 educational professionals responded to a set of three study vignettes that asked for recommendations for accommodations or alternate assessments appropriate for the scenarios. Participants also provided open-ended responses that justified their recommendations. Four randomly assigned conditions controlled for test subject (math or reading), student skill level (two or five grades below grade level in math and/or reading), and communication mode used in instruction (American Sign Language or a combination of sign and speech). Participant recommendations for accommodations or alternate assessments varied by test subject (math or reading) and student skill level but not by communication mode. Justifications for recommendations painted a complex picture of reasons behind proposed assessment practices. This article discusses the implications of these findings for accommodations policy as well as possible evidence toward a theory of decision making in assessment practices for students who are deaf or hard of hearing.</ab>

        <ab>IntroductionI was invited to write this article by the editor of this special issue, Leone Burton. I am not and never have been a mathematics educator, though I have worked with some. My brief was to comment on the other articles in the issue, as an outsider. Part of the purpose was to explore the relevance of this collection to educators and researchers who do not identify with mathematics. A secondary possibility was to see whether anything in my very different knowledge of learning could usefully feedback into the mathematics education field. Behind these tasks lie two deeper questions. First, to what extent does it make sense to think of learning as specific to particular disciplines or contexts, as opposed to thinking of it in more generic terms? Second, does the location and standpoint of the researcher or reader, for example inside mathematics, mathematics education, or outside both, influence the ways in which learning is approached and conceptualized? In what follows, I will present some partial answers to both these questions, drawing upon the content of the papers themselves, and my own reactions to them. Before embarking on that argument, I need to explain the ways in which I have chosen to approach the task.Though the invitation was both a privilege and an honour, its execution presents some difficult strategic problems. The easiest starting point was to identify what the paper should not be. It would be an abuse of my position to make critical judgments of each article. The authors concerned do not have any right of reply, or the opportunity to engage in a debate. In any event, readers will make their own judgments about these issues, without my help. Also, I decided not to try to summarize the arguments of each paper. To do so would be difficult and disingenuous without critical judgement, and if readers of this paper have not read the rest of the issue, they have every opportunity to do so, without me as a guide. Having made these two decisions, I was left with a more difficult problem. On the one hand, this paper has to add something new to the issue, to justify its publication. On the other hand, it would be a further abuse of my position if all I did was to insert my own piece, without detailed reference to what went before. This is particularly the case given the task I was asked to perform, and the fact that mine will be the only paper in the issue not to have undergone a rigorous refereeing process. In what follows, I have tried to resolve this dilemma by relating and developing some of my own thinking in close relation to these papers and the two fundamental questions with which I commenced writing. In order to maximize the references back to the papers in the issue, I have tried to minimize my use of other published work, though some key texts and direct sources have been included. Whether this strategy has done enough to avoid the dangers of self-indulgence and self-promotion, readers will have to judge.Positions, standpoints and starting points in understanding learningWhen the other six papers in this volume are taken together, the issues of author position, standpoint and of the starting points they adopt in studying learning are apparent. This is important in understanding learning, not least because of a point made strongly by Runessonâthat how we understand learning depends upon the theoretical position adopted. She goes on to describe and advocate a particular theoretical approach, variation theory, and shows how this can help us think about both learning process and learning content at the same time. Both commonalities and differences across the six are significant. I will take commonalities first. Most obviously, all are directly concerned with mathematics education. This means that the nature of mathematics is either a major or minor theme in every piece. However, this is always linked either to the broader values and purposes of mathematics and to the processes of curriculum design or to pedagogical principles and student needs, or both. In tackling these difficult issues, all the authors recognize that they are dealing with complex social and political processes that are value-laden. Put differently, they do not believe that it is the nature of the discipline of mathematics alone, or of its underlying principles, which should determine the curriculum. There are clues in some of the papers that suggest to readers like me who do not know the field, that the collective stance adopted here is radical and contested. The next common position is a central interest in pedagogy or didacticsâin how to teach mathematics to improve the learning of pupils and students. These are not papers about learning or education per se. Furthermore, when looking for improvement there is an implicit assumption that improving the work of teachers is the main way in which learning of mathematics can be improved. The next commonly held view is that learning always entails the interaction between several factors, rather than the taking of one foundational or primary variable. Finally, despite subtle and important variations, all the papers eschew positivism and crude neo-realism, approaching research from a more broadly qualitative and interpretative position. Authors are concerned with understanding the complex processes of learning, not measuring them. This remains true even when terms sometimes associated with positivism are used, for example âscienceâ by Van den Heuvel-Panhuizen, and âexperimentâ by Arzarello et al. In the case of Walshaw, there is an explicit adoption of a post-structuralist position, using an experimental form of writing to make her argument.The key difference between the papers that I wish to point up here is what might be termed the starting point in examining the complexity of learning, and the range of factors within that complexity that are directly addressed and acknowledged. Thus, Van den Heuvel-Panhuizen and Petocz and Reid focus mainly on curriculum contentâon what should be learned. Runesson shares this view, but examines it in direct relation to the learning processes of students. Walshaw, on the other hand, focuses primarily on the student, and explicitly on the gendered experiences of learning mathematics. Bills and Husbands centre on values, both in the content of mathematics education, and in the processes of learning, also through the focus on one teacher. This, in turn, introduces the significance of contestation and disputation into learning debates. Arzarello et al. focus more explicitly on the learning process and its pedagogical implications.When these various starting points are taken together, one of the shared perspectives of all authors is reinforced and extended. Thus, it becomes highly apparent that learning is indeed complex, but also that it is also relational. By this I mean that there is no simple logical starting point, from which other interrelated variables can or should be understood. None of these papers is inherently weaker or stronger than the others simply because of the starting point adopted. Furthermore, if we change one factor in the complexity that is learning, others may also change reciprocallyârelationally. Each factor can only be understood in relation to the others, and we cannot hold everything constant, whilst we change one aspect. In my view, the implications of this may be slightly problematic for some of the analyses here, in that most authors concentrate on changing one or two factors, content and pedagogy for example, but without the space fully to explore the unintended implications of their changes for other parts of the complexity that is learning.This view of learning as complex and relational is strengthened if some factors that are largely missing from these papers are added to the mix. There is little discussion here about the nature of education and schooling as macro institutional phenomena, despite the fact that mathematics education operates within them. There is little attention given to what is sometimes termed informal learning, and informal learning outcomes. Again, though several papers touch upon it, there is little explicit focus on the wider social, economic, political and historical contexts that locate learning and mathematics education. I do not make these points to call the authors to task. No single paper can cover all of this, and each author has rightly selected their own focus of attention. My point is simply to reinforce the fact that learning is complex and relational.Advancing our theoretical understanding of learningAt this point, my own personal interests and standpoint, including my approach to the two questions set out in the opening paragraph, exert a more explicit influence on this paper. For my interest in learning is primarily theoretical, including the implications of particular theoretical positions for improving (or inhibiting) practice. Individually and collectively, these papers can help significantly with that project. In order to show how or, more accurately, to develop one particular construction of how, I want to focus on the need to overcome four troubling dualisms that often impede and distort the ways in which learning is understood. Each of these proposals is contestable and contested, though each, I would argue, is supported by much of the argument and evidence within this issue. Before embarking on the list, I need to make a more general point about theories of learning.Following Runesson, I have already argued that we understand learning differently from different theoretical positions. I now want to strengthen that claim. As Arzarello et al. argue, humans often understand through metaphor, and theoretical approaches to learning are no different. Thus Sfard (1998) famously differentiated between those who understood learning primarily as acquisition or participation. The former, at its crudest level, can descend into what Bereiter (2002) terms the folk theory of learningâputting âstuffâ (mathematics) into âvesselsâ (students). In more subtle versions, the product that is to be learned retains a central importance, and purposes of learning are linked to identifying the product to be acquired, and rendering more effective the means of its acquisition. Learning as participation, on the other hand, centres on the participation in and engagement with social communities and their contextualized activities. Another common metaphor for learning, which surfaces several times in this collection, is learning as construction, focusing on the ways in which individual learners construct their own understandings of, say, mathematics, scaffolding upon pre-existing understandings (or misunderstandings). Of course, metaphors do not only originate in the English language. In French, for example, as DominicÃ© (2000, p.?11) explains, formation âdescribes the alliance of formal and experiential learning that gives shape to an adult lifeâ. Each of these, and other metaphorical ways of understanding learning, has different implications for what learning is, how good learning can be evaluated, and how learning can be improved. For learning does not have an independent, reified, external existenceâit is only that which we choose to call it, or, more accurately to conceptualize as learning. It is in this difficult context that the contributions to this issue, and what follows in this paper, should be understood.Troubling dualismsMind and bodyAt least since Descartes there has been a deep-seated western tendency to see the mind and body as distinct, with the mind as superior. Thus, it is in the mind that human identity is thought to reside and, with regard to learning, propositional knowledge and intellectual ability are seen as the prime focus of and location for learning. The result is a significant corpus of writing about learning that at best brackets the body off as peripheral, and at worst, ignores it completely. To many, mathematics epitomizes the superiority of the mind. The common view of the discipline, both inside and outside the mathematics community, is that the subject is inherently logical and rational. It represents the thinking Cartesian mind at its purest and best. It follows that learning mathematics is itself a thinking, cerebral process. Yet this view is strongly challenged within this issue. Most explicitly, Arzarello et al. argue with a powerful pedagogical example, that both mathematics itself, and the learning of mathematics is embodied. One way of understanding what this means is that learning entails an inseparable amalgam of rational thought, affective or emotional dispositions, and actual embodied practice. Arzarello et al. focus mainly on one aspect of the latterâthe use of artefacts. Put simply, it is impossible to learn mathematics, or anything else, without using artefacts, which in traditional schools might have included books, paper, pens or pencils, blackboards and desks, as well as the more modern computer-based artefacts that Arzarello et al. write about. Seeing learning as embodied is also one way of integrating some of Bills and Husbands' work on values as an explicit focus of mathematics learning and teaching.This view of mathematics learning as embodied, replicates thinking about learning in other fields. For example, two educational philosophers, David Beckett and Paul Hager, argue for the same approach in understanding learning in the workplace (Beckett &amp; Hager, 2002). The view is reinforced in some of my own on-going research into learning in English further education colleges (Hodkinson et al., 2004). My argument therefore is that for most purposes, Cartesian dualism of mind and body has ceased to be of value in understanding learning, and often actually impedes valuable understandings.Individual and socialPerhaps because of the dominance of psychology as a discipline in the learning literature, the conventional, âstandard paradigmâ (Beckett &amp; Hager, 2002) view of learning is as an individual phenomenon. Thus, a person learns in a social context, such as a classroom or workplace, which is external to them and separate from them. There are two reasons why this split should be challenged and contested. The first is the clear identification that individuals, be they students or teachers, are integral parts of the social and organizational contexts where they work and learn. Delamont (1976) clearly demonstrated some of the ways in which classroom practices were negotiated between teachers and pupils. That is, classroom cultures would be different if different pupils were present, and/or if pupils were different. Though this way of thinking is not directly represented in this issue, it is a way of understanding several of the points that are made. Thus, for example, Petocz and Reid argue that student values and perceptions should be a major factor in determining the tertiary mathematics curriculum. Put differently, mathematics students already co-construct the cultures of the classrooms and departments where they study. Therefore, their role in this construction should be acknowledged, in addition to that of teachers. Arzarello et al. make two points that can also support this position. They are careful to tell us that their experiment was conducted in âa classroom culture strongly oriented towards verbalization and discussionâ. They do not tell us how this culture has come about, but when they argue later that it is unusual in Italian mathematics classes, we can deduce that actions of teachers and probably pupils have contributed to this construction. Furthermore, implicit in their argument for new approaches to pedagogy in mathematics education, is the assumption that classroom cultures should be constructed differently.Because of our western thought traditions, at least in Anglo-American thinking and in the English language, this integration of person and social context is difficult to grasp or express, and easy to slip away from. One difficulty is that no single person is synonymous with their learning or teaching context, even though they are part of it. Each of us has lives outside our current site of learning. We had lives before it, we have lives in other contexts alongside education, and most of us will have lives after we have left that particular place of learning. Furthermore, the ways in which one person is part of a learning context may be very different from the ways in which another person is part of even the same learning context.The second problem with seeing the individual as separate from the social is more fundamentally important, for to be an individual person is to be a social person. To be human is to be socially positioned, with socially derived and constructed dispositions, and socially derived and constructed identities. In this issue, this is most clearly expressed by Walshaw, with an explicit focus on gender. In similar ways, learners (and teachers) belong to different nationalities, different ethnic groups, different social classes and different generations. Such social similarities and differences between learners in a particular place of learning are of central importance in understanding their learning.For me, the argument that any individual has to be understood as social is merely an extension of the argument for people to be seen as embodied. It follows that learning is inherently embodied and social. However, whilst accepting that learning is social, it is important to recognize that it is often also individual. That is, just as embodied learning includes the mind but does not give it either separate status or prior importance, so to say that learning is social must include the individual, without giving it either separate (non-social) status or prior importance.Thus far, I have focused on the social in relation to students, teachers and their cultural interactions. Yet several of the contributors to this issue demonstrate the significance of the social on an altogether wider scale. For they argue that mathematics itself is socially and culturally constructed, and that the design of the mathematics curriculum is itself a political and value-laden activity, even if, as Van den Heuvel-Panhuizen argues, research can help guide these decisions. Walshaw argues persuasively that decisions about mathematics education are inherently political, through her interest in the politics of gender. In many countries, the content of mathematics education and its purposes and matters of political debate and control are dominated by instrumental reasons for being numerate, as can be seen, for example, in the current UK context. Furthermore, at least in the UK and the USA, pedagogy is currently a matter of explicit political and value-laden decision making, as both governments directly intervene in prescribing and/or promoting particular approaches, even when these clash with significant research evidence. Regardless of the soundness of these policy approaches to pedagogy, they share another problem. That is, such top-down attempts to change assume that initiatives can be uniformly effective in all school cultures and settings, and will impact upon all teachers and pupils in broadly the same way. Any failures are explained by either the incalcitrance or incompetence of teachers, or by deviance in pupils. One way of understanding this mistake is that the policy innovators overlook both the socialâcultural and individual dimensions of learning, and of their interrelationshipâin addition, of course, to advancing particular partisan political positions.Process and productOne thing that differentiates the contributors in this issue from some other writers about learning is their dual focus on both the product of learning (the mathematics curriculum) and the processes of learning, including ways in which teaching can enhance those processes. The conventional, âfolk theoryâ view is that process and product are independent of each other. The first step is to identify what the product is, or should be, and the second is to identify the most effective (or, increasingly, efficient) way of transferring that product into the learner. By focusing on the relationship between the content of the mathematics curriculum and the processes of learning mathematics, my fellow contributors, taken collectively, undermine any such simplistic view, and point towards the alternative explanation that, far from being separate, process and product are intimately intertwined. The weak version of this argument is that process and product are dialectically related. The stronger version, which I lean towards, is that they are completely integrated. That is, the process is the product and the product is the process.The first part of this argument has already been advanced. That is, both the mathematics curriculum and the processes of learning mathematics are social, cultural and value-laden activities. It follows that the social, cultural and political pressures upon product and process are broadly the same, and are positioned within the same wider social, cultural and political setting. They are influenced by the same pressures at the same time.There is evidence within this issue of at least some of the ways in which the two are interrelated. To oversimplify for the purposes of illustration, several authors contrast a technical view of product and process, with a wider more social view. Petocz and Reid are explicit about what they mean by technical. For them, this entails seeing the mathematics product as separate commoditiesâwhat they term âindividual techniques and componentsâ, where the learning process consists simply of mastering and applying those techniquesâi.e., process and product are linked through acquisition. They contrast this with what they term a broader and more holistic view, where the product is mathematics as an approach to life, and the process entails understanding mathematical ways of thinking. As their primary focus is on curriculum, we have to turn to other contributors to make explicit the implications for process. Arzarello et al., for example, argue strongly that particular pedagogical processes can immensely strengthen the understanding of mathematics, through focusing on particular types of embodied classroom practice, using artefacts as instruments. Their example of developing mathematical thinking through three stages, based upon Homer's story about Penelope's knitting, is very different from the learning and using algorithms approach favoured by those with a more technical view. The implicit metaphors of learning here are participation and construction, not acquisition.Other contributors explore the links between process and product in different ways. Van den Heuvel-Panhuizen argues that decisions about product cannot be derived simply from decisions about process, that is, that neither process nor content are independently superior to the other. She goes on to show how decisions about content can and should be taken together, in an integrated way. Bills and Husbands are concerned about the linked significance of values, in both the content and process of mathematics education, through what they describe as inculcation and influence. Runesson sees both process and product as parts of understanding learning within a wider discourse. She does this by arguing that we should focus on the product of learning as socially enacted. That is, these products are constructed through the practices within the classroom, which entail the interaction between students, teacher and mathematics. Walshaw sees gender as interpenetrating both process and product, though her emphasis is on the perceptions of one student. It follows from all these contributions that, at the very least, decisions about product influence decisions about process, and vice versa.Formal and informal learningMy fourth and final troubling dualism is the common separation between formal and informal learning. It has become commonplace in western, industrialized societies to think of formal and informal learning as inherently different from each other. Thus, formal learning is planned, teacher-dominated, assessed and takes place in educational institutions, where learning is the prime official objective of activity. Informal learning, on the other hand, is unplanned, incidental, unassessed and uncontrolled by a teacher, and takes place in everyday life, where learning is not the primary purpose of the activities in which we engage. Thus, the argument goes, we learn informally through participating in everyday lifeâin the family, the local community, in the workplace and at leisure. On occasions we learn formally, if and when we attend courses at schools, colleges or university. If this argument holds water, then all six other contributors are only concerned with formal learning. Not only are all of them writing about learning within schools or tertiary educational institutions but also much of their focus is on central attributes of formal learningâcurriculum and teacher pedagogy. Coincidentally, only issues of assessment and qualification are missing from the conventional formal learning list.However, there are serious reasons to move beyond this particular dualism. The first is that however informal learning is defined it is always present within educational settings. That is, everyday learning is a major part of being a pupil or student, and also of being a teacher. This is one way of understanding school learning so memorably characterized as the âhidden curriculumâ by Jackson (1968): some young people will learn that they do not fit in, or that they are academic failures destined to enter lower-status occupations. More specifically, students may learn that mathematics is abstract and irrelevant to everyday life, as Petocz and Reid suggest. Others may learn that mathematics is difficult and not for them. Others may learn that mathematics is mainly for men. More broadly, school students learn how to be school students, which entails establishing a place within the peer culture, as well as in relation to the teacher. There is a hidden, informal curriculum for teachers too. They may learn that particular groups of pupils are unsuited to mathematics, or that certain approaches to teaching mathematics are natural, within the cultures of the schools or departments where they work.As with the division between process and product, there is a weaker and stronger way of developing this argument. The weaker version would be that there are two different types of learning (formal and informal), both of which can be found in all educational institutions, and that the two are interrelated. The interrelationship can be illustrated, for example, in the ways in which certain types of formal assessment contribute to the informal learning of success or failure, or the ways in which in-formal learning of peer-valued student behaviour can impede the formal intentions of teachers or curriculum designers. Boys speaking more than girls and dominating the use of computers is one simple example of this. The more radical view is that it makes no sense to separate formal and informal learning at all, and it is this view that I briefly develop next.Colley et al. (2003) examined an extensive range of literature on formal, informal and non-formal learning (mainly literature written in English) and found very little agreement about how to define the boundaries between them. They identified at least 20 different criteria that had been used to draw up the distinction. Although there was significant overlap between different classifications, there was no clear agreed core as to what the distinction was. This meant that learning which would be classified as informal by one person was seen as at least partly formal by someone else, and vice versa. More significantly, under all classifications, several criteria were used to define formal or informal learningâbut what happened if learning met some of these criteria and not others? They went on to argue that this shows there is no clear way to distinguish formal from informal learning. Furthermore, attempts to label learning as formal or informal are the constructions of practitioners, writers and researchers. That is, such terms are attributed to learning, and the criteria used to underpin those broad attributions can be themselves seen as attributes of learning. Thus, Beckett and Hager (2002) attribute the term âformalâ to learning that is decontextualized and an end in itself, and the term informal, to learning that is holistic and activity-based. Being decontextualized or holistic then become attributes of the formality or informality of learning, using their classificatory system. Colley et al. (2003) conclude that all learning situations entail attributes of what they term âin/formalityâ, and that what matters is the nature of these attributes and their interrelationships, in any particular learning situation.Furthermore, many of the ways of understanding the learning of mathematics that are expounded in this issue would be described as informal, by many writers. The Beckett and Hager example is a good one here. No writer in this issue would describe the learning of mathematics as decontextualized, and all would argue that it is always holistic and activity-based. Put differently, many of the more formal attributes of learning, such as a teacher-led pedagogy, a curriculum determined externally to the student and an explicit rather than incidental focus on learning, are all interpenetrated by attributes that are often termed informal.Is learning general or specific?It is now time to focus explicitly on my two opening questions. The first was âto what extent does it make sense to think of learning as specific to particular disciplines or contexts, as opposed to thinking of it in more generic terms?â The most obvious answer to this question, given the line of argument that I have adopted in this paper, is that there are many major advantages in understanding learning as being broadly similar in many different contexts. There are strong parallels between the ways in which learning is understood within this issue, and in many other contemporary analyses of learning in very different contexts. Though I do not know the literature well, I suspect that science education research parallels that in mathematics education in many ways, even though the nature of the subject content is different. More profoundly, if my argument is accepted, there are also some strong similarities between learning within education, and learning in other settings, such as local communities or even workplaces.To start at the most general level of abstraction, learning in all situations can usefully be understood as complex and relational, with no simple lines of cause and effect, and no factors or influences that are self-evidently more significant or foundational than others. More specifically, it is helpful to integrate these four dualisms in all learning situations. That is, except for very specific purposes, we should always see learning as embodied, as individual and social, as the integration of product and process, and as the integration of formal and informal. Not only is this way of thinking not restricted to particular settings, but consciously addressing the implications of integrating not only both sides of each dualism, but also integrating the four together, can help us avoid all sorts of practical and theoretical problems. For example, remembering that learning is social as well as individual helps us understand why current UK employer obsessions with education teaching people to be ready to âhit the ground runningâ when they start in work, can only be taken so far. People learn how to work by being in work, not by acquiring âtransferableâ knowledge or skills in school. It can also remind writers who adopt a predominantly social view of learning that individuals do matter, at a practical and cultural as well as moral level.The work in this issue, no doubt in common with other similar writings elsewhere, makes several significant contributions to this potentially universalistic understanding of learning. For it points strongly to two key weaknesses in much of what might broadly be termed the participatory learning literature. The first is that, even when learning is understood in this way, pedagogy really matters. The second is that we can and must find a way to understand and write about learning outcomes within this sort of theorizing, without reverting to metaphors of acquisition. In particular, the writers here make clear that curriculum content and design, currently unfashionable in much English research because of the dominance of the state imposed national curriculum, are actually central to the school learning process. Indeed, when taken as a whole, this issue significantly advances our understanding of the relationships between and/or integration of process and product in learning. However, with some notable exceptions, most writers here concentrate on what some have termed the more âformalâ processes (i.e., teacher led) and outcomes (understanding mathematics). This may be a coincidence of the focus in these particular papers, but if not, I would suggest that mathematics educators who think in ways similar to those illustrated here, could usefully revisit other more âinformalâ learning processes in schools, together with the sorts of learning outcome associated with the hidden curriculum. Put differently, seeing learning at school and learning at work as similar, may actually bring benefits to both groups of researchers.However, there is another and superficially opposite and equally important conclusion that should be drawn. The implication of taking this multi-facetted, relational and holistic view of learning is that local differences will always be of fundamental importance. To restate the argument, context (micro and macro), teacher, student, curriculum or other outcomes, pedagogy, assessment and the rest can all vary considerably from location to location. Change any one of these, and there may be reciprocal effects on the others. It logically follows that mathematics education may be different from, say, art education, and learning at school will be different from learning at work. Furthermore, learning mathematics in one classroom or in one school, or even for one pupil, may be different from learning mathematics in a different classroom, different school or for a different pupil. Most of my co-contributors to this issue either implicitly or explicitly focus on establishing more generalizable approaches within mathematics education. But there are hints in many of the analyses that local differences may matter. For example, the logic of Bills and Husbands' focus on values, is that learning is always contested. As they show, such contests can be located within individual teachers (and presumably learners), as well as between them. Though there may be some broad patterns to such contests, they will play differently in different locations. Similarly, the import of Walshaw's piece is that mathematics may well be different for male and female learners, and, at least by implication, for male and female teachers. Arzarello et al. show how the particular cultural contexts within which mathematics learning takes place may enhance or impede the chances of their proposed pedagogy being effectively introduced, and therefore succeeding. Petocz and Reid, by restricting their focus to the tertiary curriculum for mathematics, implicitly acknowledge that things might be different in schools. The significance of many particular differences in understanding learning, was summed up by Jean Lave (1996, pp. 161â162):There are enormous differences in what and how learners come to shape (or be shaped into) their identities with respect to different practices. ... Researchers would have to explore each practice to understand what is being learned, and how.These two superficially contrasting positions are actually integral parts of each other. Though our broad conceptualizations of learning can be fairly general, understanding how these conceptualizations can be applied in practice requires attention to the specifics of each location.Researcher standpointMy second major question was âdoes the location and standpoint of the researcher or reader influence the ways in which learning is approached and conceptualized?â The answer to this question can be briefer, but centres on a circularity. The simple answer is that all of the authors in this issue, including me, share, to an extent, not only similar perspectives on research but also similar perspectives on learning. The circularity originates from the fact that, for at least some of us, part of both orientations is the belief that theories of learning are themselves social constructions, in the same way that mathematics is a social construction. It then follows that if issues of position and standpoint influence learners, they also influence researchers. Put differently, if learning is inherently embodied and social, so is research. Both are human activities that cannot escape human finitude, and one way of understanding research is as a specialist form of learningâeither learning something new about a phenomenon, or learning new ways to understand it. This places many of us in what I would term a non-realist and certainly non-positivist position. Given the recent resurgence of the paradigm wars about educational research, at least in the UK and more especially the USA, it is clear that adopting such a position influences the ways in which learning is approached and conceptualized. Researchers who take a very different epistemological position will be likely to conceptualize learning differently also.Put the other way around, it is probable that there are many researchers of learning and of mathematics education, who profoundly disagree with much that lies within this issue, including my contribution to it, and even more who will like and agree with some parts of what is written in the issue but not with others. Even within the issue, there are likely to be significant differences between authors, some of which readers may be able to identify.What cannot be answered from this issue alone, is the extent to which being a mathematics educator results in a distinctive standpoint on learning, except at the level of common sense. This common sense answer would be both yes and no. Yes, in the sense that I would expect most mathematics educators to share the focus on curriculum and mathematics as a discipline, which is so evident in this issue. Similarly, it would be no surprise to see a similar, mathematics education-wide focus on teacher actionsâpedagogy or didactics. Beyond that, based on clues in several texts that views here may be radical or non-standard, I would guess that there is a similarly wide range of perceptions of research and learning within mathematics education as within the wider fields of education or learning.This leaves me with a final polemical plea. Based on the high quality papers in this issue, it is clear that mathematics education is a strong and vibrant international academic research community, which has clear links with parallel communities of mathematics teachers. The nature of this community is both a strength and a weakness. The strength is the sense of shared identity and belonging, with clear routes towards improving teaching and learning of mathematicsâeven if achieving the latter is problematic in practice. The weakness is a risk of Balkanizationâthe fragmentation of educational and learning research into discipline-led separate boxes, that seldom talk to each other, sometimes replicate each others' work, and sometimes fail to understand what others already know. I hope that inviting me to contribute to this special issue is a tiny step towards breaking down such barriers.Notes on contributorPhil Hodkinson is Professor of Lifelong Learning in the Lifelong Learning Institute of the University of Leeds, UK.

        <ab>The inequity of streaming as a method of organising classes was established by research conducted in the 1960s and 1970s. While the practice produces small advantages for limited groups of students, it hinders the academic and social advancement of the majority. Although streaming has declined, new forms of achievement grouping have emerged, with the intention of being more equitable. Recent research in the UK suggests, however, that these grouping methods have similar equity issues to streaming. Drawing on research in Australian primary schools, this article examines the practice of regrouping primary students in some schools into separate classes according to achievement levels for literacy and mathematics lessons. Results from a mixed method study collated through interviews with principals and teachers, student surveys, state-wide academic test results and classroom observations are examined in relation to equity. The findings suggest that the regrouping practice is no more equitable than streaming, albeit more politically palatable.</ab>

        <ab>A study investigated the enactment of liberatory pedagogy, which is an instructional practice that promotes equity for all students, from the perspective of two young women majoring in mathematics and elementary education.  Results revealed the important roles that personal identity and social location play in learning and teaching practice.  Specific themes that emerged included coping with being a stranger in mathematics and elementary education, wanting to replicate and improve one's own learning experience, and enacting liberatory pedagogy.  Each of these themes is discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special issue on detracking and heterogeneous grouping.  Seven teaching practices that enabled a mathematics department at an urban school to produce high and equitable achievement within a heterogeneous classroom environment are presented.  The practices involve valuing many dimensions of mathematical work, providing students with specific roles for group work, praising the contributions of students of lower intellectual status, expecting students to be responsible for each other's learning, setting high expectations for students, emphasizing hard work rather than innate ability, and highlighting valuable learning techniques.</ab>

        <ab>In Clark and Lovric (Suggestion for a theoretical model for secondary-tertiary transition in mathematics, Math. Educ. Res. J. 20(2) (2008), pp. 25-37) we began developing a model for the secondary-tertiary transition in mathematics, based on the anthropological notion of a rite of passage. We articulated several reasons why we believe that the educational transition from school to university mathematics should be viewed (and is) a rite of passage, and then examined certain aspects of the process of transition. Present article is a continuation of our study, resulting in an enhanced version of the model. In order to properly address all aspects of transition (such as a number of cognitive and pedagogical issues) we enrich our model with the notions of cognitive conflict (conceptual change) and culture shock (although defined and used in contexts that differ from the transition context, nevertheless, we found these notions highly relevant). After providing further justification for the application of our model to transition in mathematics, we discuss its many implications in detail. By critically examining current practices, we enhance our understanding of the many issues involved in the transition. The core section âMessages and implications of the modelâ is divided into subsections that were determined by the model (role of community, discontinuity of the transition process, shock of the new, role of time in transition, universality of transition, expectations and responsibilities, transition as a real event). Before making final conclusions, we examine certain aspects of remedial efforts. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>This article examines three important facets of the incorporation of new technologies into educational practice, focusing on emergent usages of the mathematical tools of computer algebra and dynamic geometry. First, it illustrates the interpretative flexibility of these tools, highlighting important differences in ways of conceptualizing and employing them that reflect their appropriation to contrasting practices of mathematics teaching. Second, it examines the cultural process of instrumental evolution in which mathematical frameworks and teaching practices are adapted in response to new possibilities created by these tools, showing that such evolution remains at a relatively early stage. Third, it points to crucial prerequisites, at both classroom and systemic levels, for effective institutional adoption of such tools: explicit recognition of the interplay between the development of instrumental and mathematical knowledge, including the establishment of a recognized repertoire of tool-mediated mathematical techniques supported by appropriate discourses of explanation and justification.

        <ab>Philosophy for Children (P4C) stems from the work of Mathew Lipman. It involves teacher modeling of exploratory talk in relation to a complex stimulus, then has students discuss together in pairs, larger groups, and the whole class to achieve consensus. The effects of P4C on quantity and quality of interactive dialog on 180 10-year-old children in primary (elementary) mainstream classes in Scotland were investigated. Video recordings of teacher-led and pupil-pupil classroom dialog before, and seven months into, participation in the program were analyzed. Changes in intervention classes included: increased use of open-ended questions by the teacher, increased participation of pupils in classroom dialog, and improved pupil reasoning in justification of opinions. There were no changes in comparison classes. Increases were found in the amount of teacher-student dialog and the amount of student-student dialog, with decreases in the amount of teacher-whole-class talk. This study found gains in cognition, which were sustained from elementary school into high school even when no further P4C was done. Socio-emotional aspects of learning also improved. Investigation of process found changes in teacher behavior and child behavior. Implications for future research, policy and practice are outlined, particularly for enhancing consistency and expanding the program.</ab>

        <ab>Design-based educational research can aid in providing a lens into understanding the complexities around imaginative methods, while also creating an avenue to share personal insights to support the solving of teaching and learning problems to direct future efforts. In this study, the 'I' narrative was extensively utilised in the form of an autoethnography perspective. This was achieved by incorporating three self-report methods within a design experiment, in order to explore the messiness associated with showcasing the creation and modification of a faculty-wide blended learning framework for STEM teachers. Data generation procedures from three sources provided the evidential basis for investigating this process: (1) self-reflection, (2) key literature findings, and (3) critical discussions from a community of inquiry. The findings identified three particular features of the process of change that were challenging, for which STEM academics required support: educators' professional context; finding models to support change in practice; and identifying the change agent. The paper argues for the program of a personal and complex methodology to inform practice, providing insights into the change process, because process is just as important as product.</ab>

        <ab>This study aims to describe how the learning study model can be used to improve lesson design and childrenâs learning outcomes by enabling them to perceive and define the critical aspects of the object of learning, guided by variation theory. Three lesson designs were used with three groups of children (A = 24, B = 13, C = 14) from two schools. The results of the first design were analyzed before the second lesson was designed and conducted in a new group, and the results of the second were analyzed before the third was designed. The patterns of variation were based on simultaneous discernment of a base amount and half or double that amount. This was made to prevent the children from understanding doubling as just copying the original amount without including the original amount in the total sum, giving the double of 4 is 4 instead of 8. The use of varied original amounts made the children separate the concepts double and half from the amount, to conceive them as relative, rather than constant, values. The results show increased learning outcomes in all groups; however, differences between pre- and posttest were significant only for Group B (p= .015).</ab>

        <ab>This article considers the question of what specific actions a teacher might take to create a culture of inquiry in a secondary school mathematics classroom. Sociocultural theories of learning provide the framework for examining teaching and learning practices in a single classroom over a two-year period. The notion of the zone of proximal development (ZPD) is invoked as a fundamental framework for explaining learning as increasing participation in a community of practice characterized by mathematical inquiry. The analysis draws on classroom observation and interviews with students and the teacher to show how the teacher established norms and practices that emphasized mathematical sense-making and justification of ideas and arguments and to illustrate the learning practices that students developed in response to these expectations.

        <ab>Although refuted many times, the commonly accepted story about Indigenous communities in Australia is that they had few counting words and thus were lacking in ways to quantify amounts. In this paper, we use the case of quantifying to discuss how Indigenous mathematics can be used, not just to help Indigenous students transition into the classroom but also back into their home communities. We argue that mathematics education must take seriously its responsibility to support Indigenous students to gain school mathematics and also to help maintain the use of traditional mathematical ideas. If this does not occur, mathematics educators will contribute, intentionally or unintentionally to the loss of Indigenous knowledge that present and future generations of Indigenous people will hold them responsible for.</ab>

        <ab>This research investigates similarities and differences in young children's early numeracy skills related to age, nationality and gender. The participants were five- to seven-year-old children from Finland and Iran. Early numeracy was investigated by using tasks measuring number-related relational skills (e.g. comparison, one-to-one correspondence) and counting skills (e.g. enumeration, number-word sequence skills). A hybrid multigroup, multiple-indicator-multiple-cause (MIMIC) approach to factorial invariance and latent mean differences between groups was used. The results showed that Finnish children had better scores in relational and counting tasks than did children in Iran. There was a gender difference in relational skills favouring girls in both countries. Younger children had weaker early numeracy skills than the older children in both countries. Comparing age groups in both countries shows a bigger difference in counting skills between young Iranian and Finnish children than between older children in both countries. The results are discussed in the context of early mathematics learning and gender equity in schooling.</ab>

        <ab>We must prepare young adolescents for a bright future by examining all of our educational practices in terms of their current and future relevance. The education we provide our students must prepare them to address enormously complex issues involving demographics and international relations, environmental and human health, and the development and application of technology. This We Believe's (NMSA, 2010) essential attributes of successful schooling can light the way to a bright future. We have clustered the 16 attributes around Four C's: constructivism, collaboration, caring, and comprehensive education. A fifth "C" that weaves through all of the others is critical thinking. The authors and their young adolescent students offer examples of these principles in action, some which may seem "old school" and some "futuristic." However, all can empower our young adolescents to thrive today as well as in a bright future of their making.</ab>

        <ab>This study investigates how mathematics secondary schools' teachers in Jordan perceive critical thinking and compares teachers' perceptions before and after educational reform. Data were collected from 12 schools twice: in 1988 and in 2004 by interviewing 47 Mathematics teachers. The interview included questions related to teachers' understanding of critical thinking, its role and importance in learning Mathematics, and instructional strategies that could help improve students' critical thinking skills. Results found no improvement in secondary Mathematics teachers' perceptions of critical thinking despite 15 years of educational reform. The majority of Mathematics teachers seemed not to have a clear and adequate understanding of critical thinking. Though most of the teachers claimed they have to teach critical thinking, more than half of them could not suggest any learning situation that could help in fostering critical thinking in Mathematics classes. Also most of the teachers claimed that critical thinking would help students in learning Mathematics; yet less than half were able to give a convincing justification for that. A small percentage of the secondary Mathematics teachers believed they can help all students to foster their critical thinking. It is thus recommended that the concept of critical thinking be transferred from the realm of rhetoric to the field of practice. The paper ends with some recommendations related to the Mathematics teachers training programs in view of the results of this study. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this research was to understand how one teacher reflected on different classroom situations and to understand whether the teacher's approach to these reflections changed over time. For the purposes of this study, we considered reflection as the teacher's act of interpreting her own practices and students' thinking to make sense of student understanding and how teaching might relate to that understanding. We investigated a middle school mathematics teacher's reflection on her students while watching videotapes of her classroom and categorized the reflection as Assess, Interpret, Describe, Justify, and Extend. The results show a higher percentage of Extend instances in later interviews than in earlier ones indicating the teacher's increasing attention to her own teaching in how her students developed their understanding. In addition, her reflection became clearer and better integrated as defined by the Cohen and Ball's triangle of interactions. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>Background/Context: Although prior research shows that the nature and extent of private tutoring practices vary significantly from country to country, differences between Eastern and Western countries in terms of their cultural and institutional aspects of private tutoring choice have not been closely examined. We need to bridge the gap by studying the phenomenon of pivate tutoring more broadly as both an individual and a collective choice, and by accounting for its variations within and between countries. Objective: The objective of this study is to describe variations in the prevalence and causes of private tutoring around the world and to understand the differences between Korea and the United States in terms of their unique needs for private tutoring and policy responses. It helps better understand the phenomenon of private tutoring more broadly as both an individual and a collective choice by accounting for its variations within and between countries. Research Design: This study draws on secondary analysis of the 1995 Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) eighth-grade student and teacher survey databases that provide information on participation in after-school math private tutoring from 41 countries, including Korea and the United States. In addition, data from United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) yearbook are analyzed for information on the status of public education. Independent samples t tests, correlations, multiple regression methods, and logistic regression methods are used to examine the relationships between private tutoring and related factors. Findings: Although after-school private mathematics tutoring is prevalent among eighth-grade students across the TIMSS nations, there are significant between-country and within-country variations in tutoring needs and participation rates. After-school private mathematics tutoring is observed more in countries with relatively poor schooling conditions and lower academic achievement. However, a critical difference between Korea and the United States is noted: Tutoring in Korea serves primarily enrichment needs for higher achieving college-bound students, whereas tutoring in the United States is primarily for meeting remediation needs of lower achieving students. Further, the two countries diverge in their policy responses to tutoring needs: Private tutoring in Korea is seen as a threat to public education and has been regulated by the government, whereas private tutoring in the United States is seen as bolstering public education and receives support from the government. Conclusions: Private tutoring may function as a double-edged sword. On one hand, private tutoring stems from collective needs for providing supplementary education as compensation for limited schooling opportunities and from individual needs for academic remediation. On the other hand, private tutoring often serves high-achieving students for enrichment or college preparation, which may erode the idea of equal educational opportunities as envisioned by public schooling. The policy challenge is capitalizing on private tutoring as bolstering academic excellence and equity in public education, while counteracting its potential threats to public schools.

        <ab>Specialized science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) schools create niche areas in an attempt to attract the best students, establish the school status, and justify their privilege to valuable resources. One Singapore STEM school does this in applied science learning to differentiate its curriculum from the national prescribed curriculum. Reflecting on the issues of curriculum innovation from the perspective of a teacher and head of department in this school, the second author discusses the constraints in curriculum innovation in a specialized school context embedded within a larger system of the national curriculum. We reflect on her experiences in designing, planning, writing, and implementing applied science courses and the challenges in having to simultaneously address the standardized assessment guidelines.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes an elementary teacher's implementation of sociocultural theory in practice. Communication is central to teaching with a sociocultural approach and to the understanding of students; teachers who use this theory involve students in explaining and justifying their thinking. In this study ethnographic research methods were used to collect data for 4 1/2 months in order to understand the mathematical culture of this fourth-grade class and to portray how the teacher used a sociocultural approach to teach mathematics. To portray this teaching approach, teaching episodes from the teacher's mathematics lessons are described, and these episodes are analyzed to demonstrate how students created taken-as-shared meanings of mathematics. Excerpts from interviews with the teacher are also used to describe this teacher's thinking about her teaching. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>The 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study data from 46 countries showed that, although the national level of teacher quality in the United States was similar to the international average, the opportunity gap in students' access to qualified teachers between students of high and low socioeconomic status (SES) was among the largest in the world. Cross-national analyses revealed that the countries with better teacher quality produced higher mathematics achievement. However, larger opportunity gaps in access to qualified teachers did not predict larger achievement gaps between high-SES and low-SES students cross-nationally. These analyses provide empirical, cross-national evidence of the importance of investing in teacher quality for improving national achievement. National policies and practices related to improving teacher quality appear to be a promising area for future research to identify how other countries have achieved both excellence and equity in student achievement.

        <ab>Abstract: This study investigates the impact of language on studentsâ learning of mathematics. A comparison has been made between English and Korean speaking university studentsâ discourses on infinity. In Korean, unlike in English, there is a disconnection between colloquial and mathematical discourses on infinity, in that the mathematical word for infinity is not a formalized version of a colloquial word but a novel sound, inspired by a Chinese term for infinity. This difference was expected to be paralleled by certain dissimilarity between the ways the discourses of the two groups developed toward the mathematical discourse on infinity. Data with the help of which we intended to test this hypothesis were collected through surveys and interviews. A total of 132 English speakers and 126 Korean speakers participated in the survey and then twenty paired representatives were selected from each group for follow-up interviews. It was found that in spite of the comparable levels of mathematical performance, there was, indeed, a visible dissimilarity between mathematical discourses on infinity of Korean- and English-speaking students. In general, whereas no group could pride itself on a well-developed mathematical discourse on infinity, the mathematical discourse of the English speakers, just like their colloquial discourse, was predominantly processual, whereas the Korean-speaking studentsâ talk on infinity was more structural and, in an admittedly superficial way, closer to the formal mathematical discourse.</ab>

        <ab>The writer considers the reproduction of social class inequalities via mathematics pedagogies in primary schools in South Africa.  A technique for the analysis of classroom observation and student performance data that is rooted in sociological theory is devised in order to develop an analytic framework capable of capturing a wide variation in pedagogic practice and show the implications of this variation for student learning.  The focus is on how the structuring of social relations connects to the structuring of knowledge and what the implications of this are in terms of how children of different social-class positions are socialized into school ways of knowing, or the school code.  The equity debate in mathematics education and schooling is considered more generally by showing how inequalities are reproduced through pedagogy.</ab>

        <ab>Three studies investigated homeâschool alignment for mathematics reform in the primary grades.  In the first study, 42 parents saw videotaped vignettes depicting teaching and learning in mathematics reform classrooms and were interviewed about their beliefs regarding the utility and efficacy of what they saw.  Parents endorsed reform classroom practices such as sharing solution strategies, taking children's thinking as a starting point for instruction, and providing indirect forms of teaching assistance during problem solving.  Other practices, such as collaborative problem solving and discussion of mathematical concepts, were more controversial.  Few parents gave justifications based on an elaborated personal learning theory; instead, their beliefs were reminiscent of diSessa's (1993) construct of phenomenological primitives, which posits piecemeal and perhaps inconsistent elements of knowledge.  The second study compared the scaffolding of arithmetic word problems provided to 11 children by their parents and teachers.  Parents tended to provide much more direct forms of assistance than did teachers.  Parental assistance was directed toward managing goals and defining problems; teachers spent more time helping children elaborate and make sense of problems.  The third study examined the impact of a pilot program that provided parents with information, examples, and companion homework problems on student achievement.  Children of parents who participated in the educational program performed at a higher level on independent measures of problem solving than did children whose parents did not participate.

        <ab>The authors, science teachers from Waimea Canyon Middle School in Waimea, Hawaii and an assistant professor of science education at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, discuss implementing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) pedagogy in their classes for the 2009-2010 school year. Science topics such as the properties of matter, metric measurements, and the solar system were taught using STEM methods. Teaching methods such as laboratory projects, self-directed inquiry, and scientific inquiry methods are described. The middle school teachers' adoption of STEM pedagogy was funded by the Kauai STEM (KSTEM) grant program.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this article is to explore how inscriptions are used to create argumentative positions in the 2 classroom episodes, Batteries and AIDS. This activity is similar to a prominent practice of scientific communities: the use of inscriptions to advance knowledge claims. We begin by discussing the meaning and function of inscriptions in scientific communities and then apply some notions from the history and sociology of science to our analyses of the case study data in the 2 episodes. In addition, we address some of the challenges for teachers in incorporating scientific practices into their classroom activities. Among these challenges is the need to alter the nature of the problems and inscriptions used as well as change classroom discourse structures. In our analyses of the 2 episodes, we found that the classroom activities resembled those of scientific communities in several ways: Real-world, dilemma-driven problems were presented; students evaluated the inscriptions offered in terms of their adequacy for advancing particular knowledge claims; and the teachers helped their students reflect on, clarify, expand, evaluate, oppose, or integrate each other's explanations into their argumentative positions. We also found that the teachers legitimated student contributions to the discussion by revoicing their arguments. Despite the positive findings from our analyses, we were able to identify and illustrate one additional challenge for future design experiments: How do we orchestrate the multiple voices of the classroom in an equitable fashion while pursuing our instructional goals?</ab>

        <ab>A study investigated the challenges and possibilities faced by teachers in implementing mathematics reform in culturally, socioeconomically, and linguistically diverse urban environments. Participants were two mathematics teachers in urban schools, one of whom took part in a project focused on equitable assessment practices for bilingual youth and one of whom took part in a project aimed at making mathematics accessible to all students.  Findings revealed two challenges that face urban teachers as they attempt to engage students in meaningful mathematics learning.  These are the need to make cultural connections with their students and the need to engage students in rich mathematical activities that focus on relevancy and understanding.  A framework for assessing the task of addressing mathematical and cultural issues simultaneously is provided.</ab>

        <ab>The practical work component offers unique challenges for university science courses. This is even more pertinent in an Open and Distance Learning (ODL) environment like the Bindura University of Science Education's Virtual and Open Distance Learning (VODL) programme. Effective ODL education should be flexible enough to accommodate science disciplines with practical components. The main challenges with practical work in ODL are that students are geographically scattered and that they come from very different educational backgrounds. In spite of these constraints, there is an equivalence motive as justification for compulsory practical work as a means to put degrees and diplomas in science education awarded through ODL programmes on the same level of achievement as those offered conventionally as they should equally develop practical scientific inquiry and problem solving skills. This Case Study evaluates the use of instructional technologies for science practical work, adopting Kumar et al (2005)'s five-stage model. The research revealed that although lecturers place great value on practical work, in practice they prefer using lecture notes and internet downloads more than other instructional technologies. Research participants do not use online tutoring at all though the philosophy of VODL requires the use of such technologies that support student-centred learning.</ab>

        <ab>The suburbanâurban achievement gap (diminishing until the 1980s) has stopped its narrowing trend, and single-sex schools are proliferating as a reform model, especially in urban areas. In this study researchers interviewed eight elementary school girls (in an all-girls school) three times over 2 years, and the resulting 23 transcripts were analyzed with focused and axial coding. Themes were constructed from these girls' meaning-making, including the challenge of gender stereotypes, an enthusiasm about math, a vision of unlimited futures, a sense of justice and personal ethics in relationships, presence of uncertainties in their lives, their reflections on the âgoodâ teacher, and the strong influence of family belonging. The authors draw implications from the meanings these girls make of their lived experiences to teachers' understanding and classroom practice; and they also connect the themes to contemporary culture, including the field of girls' studies.</ab>

        <ab>Efforts to change policies and the environments in which people live, work, and play have gained increasing attention over the past several decades. Yet health promotion frameworks that illustrate the complex processes that produce health-enhancing structural changes are limited. Building on the experiences of health educators, community activists, and community-based researchers described in this supplement and elsewhere, as well as several political, social, and behavioral science theories, we propose a new framework to organize our thinking about producing policy, environmental, and other structural changes. We build on the social ecological model, a framework widely employed in public health research and practice, by turning it inside out, placing health-related and other social policies and environments at the center, and conceptualizing the ways in which individuals, their social networks, and organized groups produce a community context that fosters healthy policy and environmental development. We conclude by describing how health promotion practitioners and researchers can foster structural change by (1) conveying the health and social relevance of policy and environmental change initiatives, (2) building partnerships to support them, and (3) promoting more equitable distributions of the resources necessary for people to meet their daily needs, control their lives, and freely participate in the public sphere.</ab>

        <ab>School subjects are analogous to medieval alchemy. There is a magical change as mathematics, science, and social sciences move from their disciplinary spaces into the classroom. The educational and social psychologies have little or nothing to do with understanding disciplinary practices. They are intellectual inventions for normalizing and governing the child's conduct, relationships, and communications. The author examines this alchemy in standards-based mathematics educational policy and research for K-12 schools. He argues that (a) the emphasis on âproblem solving,â collaboration, and âcommunities of learningâ sanctify science and scientists as possessing authoritative knowledge over increasing realms of human phenomena, thus narrowing the boundaries of possible action and critical thought; and (b) while reforms stress the need for educational equity for âall children,â with âno child left behind,â the pedagogical models divide, demarcate, and exclude particular children from participation.

        <ab>This classroom observation study explored how science teachers ( N = 22) teach for creativity in grades 5-10 in Oman. We designed an observation form with 4 main categories that targeted the instructional practices related to teaching for creativity: questioning strategy, teacher's responses to students' ideas, classroom activities to support creativity, and whole-lesson methods that foster creativity. An open-ended survey was also designed to explore participants' justifications for their instructional decisions and practices. The findings indicate that the overall level of teaching for creativity was low and that participants' performance was the highest for teacher's responses to students' ideas category and the lowest for classroom activities to support creativity category. We observed that a teacher-centered approach with instructional practices geared toward preparing students for examinations was dominant and that these science teachers were bound to the textbook, following cookbook-style activities. Participants believed that they did not have enough time to cover the content and teach for creativity and that they were not prepared to teach for creativity. Based on these findings, we recommend that programs be developed to prepare science teachers to teach for creativity.</ab>

        <ab>Background/Context: The UN Sustainable Development Goals include a renewed commitment to inclusive and equitable education for all and will maintain pressure on governments in lowincome countries to ensure this provision. A range of prominent researchers and institutional actors continue to explore and to promote low-fee private schools (LFPSs) as a viable option for achieving universal access to basic education. The emphasis on LFPSs can be seen as part of the push for education policies that attempt to improve educational access and quality not through the strengthening of public education but through the establishment of public-private partnerships. Focus of Study: In this paper we explore the Kenyan government's engagement with LFPSs, document and assess the impact of this support on the behavior of LFPS and clarify key actor perspectives and responses within this context. Research Design: Through a qualitative case study of two LFPSs in a large urban informal settlement near Nairobi, we focus on the dynamic interaction and delicate equilibrium within which government officials, LFPS representatives, parents, and students not only interact with but influence each other. Data for the study were gathered over the course of 8 weeks during May and June of 2010 in the urban slum called Mathare Village in Nairobi through document review, 35 interviews, and school visits. Conclusions: The findings suggest that LFPSs do not function in practice as in theory, and crucially, that there are inherent trade-offs, tensions, and unexpected dynamics in operation that have serious consequences for such issues as quality and equity, even when supported by formal government policy designed to address these aspects. The study reinforces the importance of national governments and international bodies increasing the resources devoted to improving access to, and the quality of, public education.</ab>

        <ab>The Research Advisory Committee (RAC) of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics is focusing on the relationship between research and development in its deliberations for 1996.  It particularly looks at the types of justifications given for new approaches to materials development and teacher development and at the relation of materials development and teacher development to research. This focus extends the RAC's previous examination of the relationship between theory and practice.  The view that emerges from the current analysis is generally optimistic, but there is one parameter that needs further clarification, namely, the tension between innovation and research that is central to research carried out to improve the field of mathematics education.  The RAC proposes that the primary goal of such research should be to study a particular innovation critically, examining the proposals and assumptions it encompasses. This approach is characterized by an openness to doubt that acts in differentiating developmental research from product promotion.</ab>

        <ab>In recent years the mathematics education research community has undergone a social turn towards a greater interest in the values and broader educational purposes of mathematics education, including issues of social justice and citizenship education. Building on these developing interests, this paper presents a conceptual framework that links the teaching of school mathematics with moral education. Then, in a case study involving two countries, England and Canada, this framework is used to explore the affordances and constraints faced by mathematics teachers in those countries if they want to intentionally practice moral education in the classroom.

        <ab>The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) was designed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to evaluate the quality, equity, and efficiency of school systems around the world. Specifically, the PISA has assessed 15-year-old students' reading, mathematics, and science literacy on a 3-year cycle, since 2000. Also, the PISA collects information about how those outcomes are related to key demographic, social, economic, and educational variables. However, the preponderance of reports involving PISA data focus on achievement variables and cross-national comparisons of achievement variables. Challenges in evaluating achievement of students from different cultural and educational settings and data concerning students' approaches to learning, motivation for learning, and opportunities for learning are rarely reported. A main goal of this themed issue of Teachers College Record (TCR) is to move the conversation about PISA data beyond achievement to also include factors that affect achievement (e.g., SES, home environment, strategy use). Also we asked authors to consider how international assessment data can be used for improving learning and education and what appropriate versus inappropriate inferences can be made from the data. In this introduction, we synthesize the six articles in this issue and themes that cut across them. Also we examine challenges associated with using data from international assessments, like the PISA, to inform education policy and practice within and across countries. We conclude with recommendations for collecting and using data from international assessments to inform research, policy, and teaching and learning.</ab>

        <ab>This article provides the background and context to the important issue of assessment and equity in relation to Indigenous students in Australia.  Questions about the validity and fairness of assessment are raised and ways forward are suggested by attending to assessment questions in relation to equity and culture-fair assessment.  Patterns of underachievement by Indigenous students are reflected in national benchmark data and international testing programmes like the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and the Program for International Student Assessment.  The argument developed views equity, in relation to assessment, as more of a sociocultural issue than a technical matter.  It highlights how teachers need to distinguish the âfunds of knowledgeâ that Indigenous students draw on and how teachers need to adopt culturally responsive pedagogy to open up the curriculum and assessment practice to allow for different ways of knowing and being.

        <ab>04What features of mathematical thinking do students exhibit when they use dynamic software in their problem solving approaches? To what extent does the systematic use of technology favour students' development of problem solving competences? What type of reasoning do students develop as a result of using a particular tool? This study documents features of mathematical practice that students display when they systematically use dynamic software in problem solving. In particular, the use of the software involves the construction of simple geometric configurations that become a platform to formulate questions that lead them to the construction or recognition of mathematical relationships. In this process, students can build their own repertoire of mathematical results and also utilize their previous knowledge to support, justify, or explain their conjectures. Here, it becomes important for students to develop methods and strategies to observe particular relationships, express them using specific notation, and provide arguments to demonstrate and communicate their results.

The project involved students employing measurement and numeracy skills in order to build benches for the school grounds.  For children, working out math problems while using their hands enriches the core math standards being taught and motivates them to want to come to math class.</ab>

        <ab>Groups that created more correct ideas (correct contributions or CCs) might be more likely to solve a problem, and students' recent actions (micro-time context) might aid CC creation. 80 high school students worked in groups of 4 on an algebra problem. Groups with higher mathematics grades or more CCs were more likely to solve the problem. Dynamic multilevel analysis statistically identified watersheds (breakpoints) that divided each group's conversation into distinct time periods with many CCs versus few CCs, and modeled the groups' 2,951 conversation turns. Wrong contributions, correct evaluations of one another's ideas, justifications, and polite disagreements increased the likelihood of a CC. In contrast, questions, rude disagreements, and agreements reduced it. Justifications had the largest effects, whereas the effects of correct evaluations lasted 3 speaker turns. Some effects differed across groups or time periods. In groups that solved the problem, justifications were more likely to yield CCs, and questions were more likely to elicit explanations. Meanwhile, the effects of agreements and correct evaluations on CCs differed across time periods. Applied to practice, teachers can encourage students to evaluate others' ideas carefully and politely, express and justify their own ideas, and explain their answers to group members' questions.</ab>

        <ab>This special issue grew out of a symposium that I organized and chaired at the Tenth Conference of the European Association for Research into Learning and Instruction (EARLI), held in Padova, Italy from the 26â30 August 2003. The special issue was announced and papers called for over the mathematics education networks in the following way:Mathematics education is well established as a field of study in its own right. Researchers in this field draw on literature from psychology, sociology and anthropology to substantiate their theoretical positions but have also contributed to the development of theories and practices within the area of learning and teaching mathematics. Because of the interesting problems encountered in mathematics classrooms, mathematics education has provided a seductive area within which some of those in education, and other cognate disciplines, have sited their research. However, many such are unfamiliar with the substantial literature that now exists within mathematics education itself nor, despite considerable advancement in the field, necessarily cognisant of major disagreements, problems and contradictions that remain unresolved. Papers are invited that air and discuss âprovocationsâ, drawing on established research and raising challenges to mathematics education and different approaches to such challenges within the field.I am delighted, therefore, to present this special issue consisting, as it does, of papers from across the spectrum of primary to tertiary education, with author representation from English-speaking countries across the world, and from the non-first language English countries of Italy, The Netherlands and Sweden. Authors have been encouraged to present their provocations in ways that are meaningful to the non-mathematics education community. This is in the hope of building bridges with those outside mathematics education who find the challenges of learning and teaching mathematics engaging but who are unaware of the kinds of debates ongoing within mathematics education and, in part, represented here.The issue consists of six articles together with a commentary paper on these that Phil Hodkinson of the Lifelong Learning Institute at the University of Leeds was kind enough to write for it. By this means, I hope that the issue will not only offer readers of the journal some interesting, indeed provocative, ideas but also that the views on the papers, expressed by Phil Hodkinson, from the position of a generalist, will offer an additional take to engage readers.The first article in the issue is by colleagues Liz Bills and Chris Husbands, at the University of East Anglia in Norwich. The title is âValues education in the mathematics classroom: subject values, educational values and one teacher's articulation of her practiceâ. The authors address the relationship between general social and values education, the development of which they call âthe most important aim of schoolingâ, and mathematics education practice, one of the mechanisms through which this development is influenced. For those not engaged in mathematics education, there might be some surprises in the authors' references to the ways in which mathematics bears upon values issues and the ways in which they sensitively discuss one teacher's dilemmas in confronting the tensions between subject-specific, that is mathematical, and general values in her classroom.The second article, âGetting political and unraveling layers of gendered mathematical identificationsâ is by Margaret Walshaw of Massey University, New Zealand. Margaret uses a post-structural analysis to draw attention to the politicization of knowledge and the ways that focusing upon âgetting the analysis rightâ can possibly lead to a failure to recognize that âhidden forms of social relations lie behind what our research participants tell usâ. In this paper we meet Rachel, a senior secondary student of mathematics, who is attempting to deal with her mathematical identity and its gendering both in the classroom and in her relations with significant others. Through the format that Margaret has chosen to present her work, a split text strategy using the interview transcript and her analysis of the interview, she provokes the reader to reconsider constructions normally taken for granted in academic writing.Marja van den Heuvel-Panhuizen, who is at the Freudenthal Institute, Utrecht University, The Netherlands but, at the time of writing, was a visiting professor at the University of Dortmund in Germany, poses the question: âCan scientific research answer the âwhatâ question of mathematics education?â Marja begins by clearly articulating a contradiction that emerges from the papers of many who write about mathematics learning and teaching: âfor outsiders mathematics may be a school subject with an indisputable content, but for those who are involved in mathematics education it is clearly notâ. She points out that decisions on content are not even necessarily the same where approaches are shared, never mind where these differ and points to the consequent inadequacies of testing regimes. She asks does research help to find an answer to the question of what should be taught, a question which policy-makers and politicians, as well as the general public, recognize as most important but about which there is apparently little agreement. She develops her argument through published work and concludes that research not only must address this question; she proposes that the European approach to the didactics of mathematics is one way of doing so.A team, consisting of Ferdinando Arzarello, Ornella Robutti and Luciana Bazzini, from the University of Torino in Italy, are the authors of the next paper entitled âActing is learning: focus on the construction of the mathematical conceptsâ. They move to the primary school where, in a particular classroom with a specific problem, they investigate the interaction between language, gesture and representational artefacts that support pupils' construction and understanding of meaning associated with variable and function. The provocation that they offer to practitioners is to acknowledge and build upon these interactions. To those who assert this important relationship between action, language and cognition, they offer a further provocation to foster âits transposition in school practiceâ. The authors critique the symbolicâreconstructive mode of learning that underlies transmission teaching and support an approach that promotes involvement in activities that help to build an experiential base for learning. They draw attention, in particular, to the role of technological artefacts. However, as they point out, artefacts, alone, are insufficient to promote learning; as we know, learning depends upon the sensitive understanding and use of these artefacts made by the teacher and students in interaction. Herein lies the provocation to practitioners.The fifth paper comes from Ulla Runesson, a member of the phenomenographic school of educational research associated with Gothenburg University, in Sweden. Her paper is called âBeyond discourse and interaction. Variation: a critical aspect for teaching and learning mathematicsâ. She utilizes transcripts from respected published work to demonstrate the different insights that can be obtained by the application of variation theory, a theory of learning that draws attention to the object that is necessary for learning to take place and the need to vary the learner's encounters with this object. She calls for this kind of eclectic approach to broaden perspectives on research data and research publications and points out that âby comparing analyses of the same data from different theoretical positions I have addressed the âprovocationâ created by the relationship between theoretical positions and findings of research in mathematics education. I have been proposing an alternative theoretical position, that of variation theory, for examining classroom learning in mathematics due to its power to reveal what can be learnedâ.The final paper, âRethinking the tertiary mathematics curriculumâ, by Peter Petocz and Anna Reid at Macquarie University in Australia, moves into university studies but focuses on the perspectives of the students, how they understand the nature of mathematics and its role in their future professional lives, and how this impacts upon their learning while at university. The authors' intent is to provoke a debate on the aims and nature of the tertiary mathematics curriculum. After examining a range of data from studies on student perspectives, they conclude by summarizing the impact on curriculum development and review, from the points of view of the institution, the students' professional preparation and learning needs, the coherence of the individual units that comprise a course, and the teaching and learning strategies incorporated in the classroom. They draw the conclusion that âstudents at university level will have some ideas about their future work, but they are not generally aware of the relation between these ideas and their conceptions of their subject, learning in the subject, and their overall approach to their studies. If we discuss these ideas with them, we can make explicit the relationship between narrower and broader views of professional work and limiting and integrated conceptions of learning in a subjectâ. This is, indeed, a provocation to many of those currently teaching mathematics at tertiary level.In his commentary paper, âLearning as cultural and relational: moving past some troubling dualismsâ, Phil Hodkinson identifies similarities and differences in the six papers. He finds, not unexpectedly in an issue devoted to provocations, that the papers share an approach to mathematics education that is potentially contentious; it is broad, situated, embraces complexity and the role of values and purposes. Despite being situated within mathematics education, he finds that the papers embrace broad pedagogic perspectives that have the teacher in a central position. But these are not papers within a positivist or neo-realist position. All recognize the multi-variate, relational and complex nature of research in this field and look to interpretive research to help understand the influences at work. Underlining this, Phil Hodkinson reflects upon a number of dualisms that pervade a lot of academic writing, in particular but not only within mathematics education, and ways in which he perceives the papers in this Issue as challenging them. The dualisms he addresses are mind/body, individual/social, process/product and formality/informality of learning. This thought provoking paper concludes with a similar appeal to the one that I made at the outset for us as researchers in education, first, and mathematics education second, to turn our backs on Balkanization and engage with the issues and challenges that we jointly face building upon the contributions that are there to be found in the discipline-specific, as well as the generalist, literatures.While I hoped that Phil Hodkinson would do the kind of job that he has done, I cannot say that I expected the thorough, challenging and extremely interesting paper that he has provided, for which I am extremely grateful. In conclusion, I would also like to thank all the other authors represented here for their willing attention to detail and reactions to critique as well as the colleagues who acted as reviewers of papers for this special issue. Without their work, I would not have been able to produce an issue that, I hope, will be of interest and challenge to readers. In addition to members of the Editorial Board of the journal, thanks to Mike Askew, Mary Barnes, Bill Barton, Alan Bishop, Suzanne Damarin, Ed Dubinsky, Kathleen Lynch, John Mason, Anna Pendry and Hilary Povey and to Paula Peachey for her unstinting administrative support.Notes on contributorLeone Burton, the editor of this special issue, is Professor Emerita in Mathematics Education at the University of Birmingham and Visiting Professor at King's College, London. Her research interests span problem-solving, epistemology, assessment and social justice in mathematics classrooms from pre-school to university. Her most recent book is Mathematicians as enquirers: learning about learning mathematics (2004).</ab>

        <ab>âWhat worksâ policies are the latest incarnation of best practices in educational research. Instituted by various organisations internationally, they define what kind of research counts as âevidenceâ for reform-oriented decision-making. While some countries rely on systematic analyses and meta-analyses, the U.S. favours primary quantitative longitudinal research designs as evidence. Critics claim that institutionalising methods will distort educational research. This commentary discusses these two concerns about the research designs favoured in the American âwhat worksâ milieu: missing research and missing data. To explore whether those concerns are warranted, we focus on mathematics education, a national priority in the U.S. After establishing enduring questions in mathematics education, we provide primers on quantitative longitudinal research designs and the analysis of missing data due to attrition. Then, we address these questions about the state of research: As a research community, are we missing research with implications for mathematics education? Are we missing data with implications for the inferences that can be made? This review of research questions and analyses in recent studies suggests missing data poses a greater threat than missing research. Finally, we make recommendations for minimising the risk of missing evidence that will be of interest to international educational researchers in any discipline.</ab>

        <ab>A study examined teachers' beliefs about assessment and the connections teachers make between assessment, teaching, and learning. The participants were three female elementary school teachers. Analysis of the data revealed that the teachers used assessment to place students in the âappropriate levelâ of math, to formally describe students' performance and to justify their own grading system, and to prepare students for mandated tests; that teachers perceived the existence of an official math curriculum, were dissatisfied with the implemented curriculum, questioned the relevance of some of the content they taught, acknowledged their own difficulty in understanding math, and were encouraged by their own dissatisfaction with current curriculum and teaching practices to try out alternative instructional activities defined as more relevant based on their own context and experience; and that the teachers saw students' learning as resulting mainly from a fixed level of ability and did not regard assessment as a process that informs teaching or as a way to help students develop mathematical knowledge.</ab>

        <ab>The PRISM program partnered K-12 teachers with science and mathematics graduate students who served as Scientists or Mathematicians-in-Residence in the teachers' classrooms. The teachers and graduate students participated in a Summer Inquiry Institute during which they learned about inquiry-based instruction, and then collaborated to develop and co-teach content-rich, inquiry-based instruction in the teachers' classrooms for one academic year. In the first three years of the program, 27 teachers and 18 graduate students participated. The research study examined how participation in PRISM influenced the teachers' and graduate students' conceptions of inquiry, explored what they learned about inquiry by implementing inquiry together in the classroom, and studied the role that their collaboration played in the development of their conceptions of inquiry. Conceptions and use of inquiry were examined through surveys, online journals, interviews and classroom observations. The results indicate that the teachers and graduate students deepened and expanded their understanding of inquiry. Particular themes emerged related to what the teachers and graduate students learned about inquiry through the act of teaching via inquiry were (a) inquiry engages students' minds not just their hands, (b) discussion is essential for student learning, and (c) teachers need to help develop a classroom culture conducive to inquiry in order for students to be successful with inquiry-based learning. This research indicates that teacher-scientist/mathematician partnerships can be beneficial to both parties when structured within a long-term professional development program that immerses the participants in the inquiry process and provides ongoing support.

        <ab>The article reports on mathematics as an unpopular subject both in Great Britain and other countries. This is because less people continue with it into post-compulsory education and if ever there are those who continue, it is because they need the subject rather than they actively enjoy it. A research also shows that people find it hard to blend their personalities with mathematics because of the subject's image. The research was the first of its kind to be made within mathematics education that will focus on unpopular representations of the subject and attempts to map their effects.</ab>

        <ab>This article explores the practice of engaging prospective elementary teachers in the analysis of lessons from different textbooks. A rationale for such engagement, based on particular teacher education goals, is provided. The article focuses on a specific lesson analysis assignment given to prospective elementary teachers in which portions of mathematics textbooks were compared and contrasted. Examination of 23 preservice teachers' analysis of two textbook lessons (one fairly traditional and one more reform oriented) revealed that, with very few exceptions, the preservice teachers searched the textbook lessons for familiar, mainly traditional instructional components. The teachers' preference for traditional lesson components appeared to contribute to a tendency to make considerable misinterpretations of the two textbook lessons. These tendencies, including ways that the teachers attempted to justify differences between the two lessons, offer important insights into prospective elementary teachers' conceptions of the role of textbooks in the teaching and learning process. In addition, these findings suggest the necessity of involving prospective teachers more extensively in the analysis of textbooks, curriculum materials, and other instruction resources so that richer, more useful conceptions may develop.

        <ab>Like most developing countries in the world, there is a huge gap in opportunities to access quality science education between students from the high- and low-socioeconomic strata of Philippine society. In establishing its own science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) high school, despite limited public funding in 1964, the government embarked on a hopeful project for continuously building up its scientific and technological work force to support modern economic development. The initial focus on elite talent development, however, eventually had to give way to legislative reforms that address issues of social equity. Greater accessibility for scholarships by underprivileged students in the provinces was accomplished, first, through the regionalization of its admission system and then, later, through its transformation into a network of science high schools across the nation. In my home country, sustaining equitable access to STEM education also means enhancing school participation through partnerships with community constituents and the private sector.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines whether preservice teachers' experiences with video analyses during teacher preparation have long-lasting effects on their practices once they enter the profession. Specifically, the authors examined whether teachers who had opportunities to analyze student thinking and learning during teacher preparation continued to do so when they reflected on their teaching effectiveness as full-time teachers. A group of elementary school teachers who attended a video-enhanced mathematics methods course were compared to a control group at the end of their first year of full-time teaching. Teachers were asked to assess two lessons they had just taught by describing lesson learning goals and providing a rating of lesson effectiveness and a rationale for their evaluation. Teachers who attended the video-enhanced course during teacher preparation outperformed their counterparts in both the quality of evidence they drew upon and their attention to individual or subgroups of learners. Study limitations and future directions are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>This paper gives a broad descriptive account of some activities that the author has designed using Sketchpad to develop teachers' understanding of other functions of proof than just the traditional function of âverificationâ. These other functions of proof illustrated here are those of explanation, discovery and systematization (in the context of defining and classifying some quadrilaterals). A solid theoretical rationale is provided for dealing with these other functions in teaching by analysing actual mathematical practice where verification is not always the most important function. The activities are designed according to the so-called âreconstructiveâ approach, and are structured more or less in accordance with the Van Hiele theory of learning geometry.

        <ab>The present study describes preschool read-alouds in terms of the types of texts to which children are exposed. The methods involved analyzing the genre and instructional foci of 426 titles read by 13 teachers throughout an entire academic year. Additionally, associations between teacher characteristics and texts teachers read in their classrooms were examined. Findings indicated that (a) narrative texts were the dominate genre read-aloud; (b) children's exposure to alphabet books, nursery rhymes, books featuring math concepts, and multicultural content occurred at generally low rates; and (c) few significant associations exist between quantity of books read and teacher characteristics.</ab>

        <ab>Reform in mathematics education has been stimulated and propelled by the publication of standards documents by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.  This article examines the vision of teacher decision making that is portrayed in NCTM Professional Teaching Standards: choosing worthwhile mathematical tasks, orchestrating and monitoring classroom discourse, creating an environment for learning, and analyzing one's practice.  The philosophical orientation and the set of commitments to teaching and learning on which the standards are based include stances on equity, curriculum, teaching, and learning. These stances are summarized under the following headings: inclusiveness, depth over coverage, teaching for understanding, active engagement of students, curriculum investigations, applications, and connections.

        <ab>A study assessed and compared the extent to which preservice programs value the development of content area knowledge and skills in secondary special educators.  Participants were 38 institutions of higher education (IHEs) from states that used special educators as content teachers and 40 IHEs from ânon-contentâ states.  Results indicate that it is becoming more common for secondary special educators to teach content subjects but that there are marked differences between many areas in this practice.  However, despite the differences in practice of the participating IHEs, there is no corresponding variation in how secondary special educators are trained.  Science and social studies are regarded as being significantly less important than English and mathematics and are provided with correspondingly less training exposure.  Anecdotal evidence indicates that the extent of exposure to content areas is limited by the requirements of general education coursework.</ab>

        <ab>Middle school students can be helped to make connections between their everyday activities and word problems using a conceptual teaching approach.  To put this approach into practice in the classroom, teachers should use cooperative groups, allow enough time to make sense of the problem, encourage reflection on the reasonableness of answers, and accept alternative solutions that can be justified.</ab>

        <ab>Models of support for students with disability and learning difficulties in mainstream classes in Australia rely extensively on teacher assistants (TAs). Current models, however, inadvertently perpetuate low expectations because providing TA support can be one of the most restrictive supports offered in a school [Giangreco, M. F. 2010a. âOne-to-One Paraprofessionals for Students with Disabilities in Inclusive Classrooms: Is Conventional Wisdom Wrong?âIntellectual and Developmental Disabilities48 (1): 1â13; Etscheidt, S. 2005. âParaprofessional Services for Students with Disabilities: A Legal Analysis of Issues.âResearch and Practice for Persons with Severe Disabilities30(2): 60â80]. In addition, the increasing instructional role of TAs in the classroom is concerning. Negative outcomes for students where TAs provide support have been noted [Giangreco, M. F., J. C. Suter, and M. B. Doyle. 2010. âParaprofessionals in Inclusive Schools: A Review of Recent Research.âJournal of Educational and Psychological Consultation20: 41â57; Webster, R., P. Blatchford, and A. Russell. 2010. âShould Teaching Assistants Have a Pedagogical Role? Lessons Following the DISS Project.â Paper Presented at the BERA annual conference, September 1â4, University of Warwick, UK]. A qualitative case study was conducted in an Australia city over three years across four primary school sites to identify the issues and propose possible solutions. The study identified five different models of TA support and deployment. It was found support models used in mainstream schools were generally inequitable â if students did not have a disability or learning difficulty they received instruction primarily from a qualified teacher, but if students had a disability or learning difficulty, they received instruction from a TA who may have had no qualifications, no involvement in planning, limited supervision and unclear reporting; and no clear duty statement requirements. A more inclusive and more equitable model of TA support is discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special section on the concept of proof in mathematics education.  By evaluating students' justifications of results, mathematics teachers can plan instruction that will move students toward more sophisticated ways of reasoning.  The proof schemes that students use can be divided into three types:  externally based proof schemes, empirical proof schemes, and analytic proof schemes. Externally based proof schemes consist of the authoritarian proof scheme, the ritual proof scheme, and the symbolic proof scheme. Empirical proof schemes comprise the perceptual proof scheme and the examples-based proof scheme.  Examples of analytic proof schemes are the transformational proof scheme and the axiomatic proof scheme.</ab>

        <ab>The present study examined whether gender, ethnicity, instructional medium and school category differences manifest in science performance and motivation to learn science among secondary school students in Sri Lanka. The mean of five successive term test scores was used as the measure of science performance. Level of motivation in terms of six dimensions was measured by using the Science Motivation Questionnaire. A sample of 1316 grade 11 students representing Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim ethnic groups from the three categories of public schools, which provide instructions in the vernacular languages of Sinhala or Tamil, participated in the study. Girls showed significantly higher performance in science compared to boys, and there was a significant gender difference in the levels of motivational dimensions in favor of girls. Although Tamil medium students possessed a higher level of motivation to learn science, Sinhala medium students outperformed their Tamil medium counterparts in science performance. Significant differences in science performance between Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim students were also observed. However, motivation towards learning science between Tamils and Muslims was not significantly different. Highly significant differences in both motivation to learn science and performance in science were found between three categories of schools. The present study provides information to education officials who have to achieve equity across gender, ethnicity, medium of instruction, and school category, teachers who deliver the subject and school principals who design academic support programs.</ab>

        <ab>This paper outlines an experiment in which pupils in Key Stage 2 were encouraged to use graphics calculators, in particular two simple programs, which helped them develop recall of their tables and allowed them to practise multiplication. The pupils responded very well to the calculators and seemed to have been motivated by them. The pupils did not find them difficult to operate and experienced very few technical problems. The authors concluded that the graphics calculator has considerable potential to enhance the mathematical experience and learning of pupils at this level, and that although the extent of the investigation was fairly limited the results were encouraging enough to justify further work in this area.

        <ab>Currently, considerable debate focuses on whether mind is located in the head or in the individual-in-social-action, and whether development is cognitive self-organization or enculturation into established practices.  In this article, I question assumptions that initiate this apparent forced choice between constructivist and sociocultural perspectives.  I contend that the two perspectives are complementary.  Also, claims that either perspective captures the essence of people and communities should be rejected for pragmatic justifications that consider the contextual relevance and usefulness of a perspective.  I argue that the sociocultural perspective informs theories of the conditions for the possibility of learning, whereas theories developed from the constructivist perspective focus on what students learn and the processes by which they do so.

        <ab>This study examined high-stakes test scores for 37,222 eighth grade students enrolled in music and/or visual arts classes and those students not enrolled in arts courses. Students enrolled in music had significantly higher mean scores than those not enrolled in music (p &lt; .001). Results for visual arts and dual arts were not as conclusive. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of academic remediation held during the instructional day that thereby denies arts instruction to students. The practice of recommending that students devote more time to English and math in lieu of music should be evaluated.</ab>

        <ab>This essay looks at reflective questions most teachers struggle with. These self-analytic questions are framed by two books in particular, Eric Gutstein's Reading and Writing the World with Mathematics and Gutstein and Peterson's Rethinking Mathematics, that advocate for the inclusion of social justice pedagogy in mathematics curriculum. This essay uses these two books to talk about the relationship between social justice educators (in all disciplines, not just mathematics) and the students they teach. Using the discussion found in both books, I argue that who we are teaching matters in how we combine social justice and academics in the classroom and that the families and communities of our students need to be actively engaged in our efforts to connect academic knowledge to social justice. I situate my argument in the writing of Paolo Freire and contemporary U.S. critical theorists currently looking at the intersection of social justice, critical theory and pedagogy.

        <ab>Background There is a growing interest in STEAM (STEM + the Arts) education as a means to enhance the creativity of STEM students and broaden interest in STEM fields. Many art educators, however, object to the instrumental justification for study in the arts as a way to improve student performance in other areas. Purpose Drawing on the first two authors' engagement in an interdisciplinary design studio, this study develops an expanded view of how STEAM might enrich engineering education in ways that more closely align with the pedagogical commitments of the arts. Design/Method This article is written as a collaborative autoethnography between the first two authors, educators in environmental engineering and art education, respectively. The study is grounded in the educational philosophy of arts advocate Maxine Greene, who views learning as an active, collaborative search for meaning, 'wide-awakeness,' and social change. Results Our dialogue reveals the potential for STEAM to provide students and educators with opportunities to explore personally relevant connections between materials, design, society, and the natural environment and to critically engage with implicit and explicit facets of disciplinary identity. Conclusions This view of STEAM simultaneously complements and challenges current conceptions of this emerging educational movement that, almost without exception, are underpinned by calls for competitive economic growth and technological development. We hope future research will build on our perspectives to continue a conversation about STEAM that considers the diverse contributions of, and mutual benefits to, all parties involved.</ab>

        <ab>One common theme underlying recent reports on science education is that the content of school science and its related pedagogical approaches are not aligned with the interests and needs of both society and the majority of the students. Most students do not find their science classes interesting and motivating. These claims are especially valid regarding those students who, in the future, will probably not embark on a career in science or engineering but will need science and technology personally and functionally as literate citizens. One key problem seems to be that few science programs around the world teach how science is linked to those issues that are relevant to students' life, environment, and role as a citizen. As a result, many students are unable to participate in societal discussions about science and its related technological applications. This paper discusses the need to incorporate socioscientific ideas into the science curricula more thoroughly. This recommendation is supported by a theoretical rationale from various sources leading to a reflection about common practices in science education in three countries: Israel, Germany, and the USA. The state-of-the-art, potentials, and barriers of effective implementation are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Informatics or computer science (the terms informatics and computer science are used as synonyms in this paper) in Austrian secondary schools is often considered âdifficultâ and ânot interestingâ because of mainly mathematical and economical contents. But informatics is much more; it is used in almost every part of the working life and can also cooperate with every subject at school. It offers a wide range of possibilities for COOL (COoperative Open Learning), an Austrian teaching model based on the Dalton Plan that provides also cooperation between different subject matters. Besides the COOL concept this paper describes some ideas for cooperation between informatics and foreign languages at secondary schools and at University level besides just ICT (Information and Communication Technology) or computer-assisted language learning. The presented tasks are part of the project âCOOL Informaticsâ (according to COoperative Open Learning) that aims at developing COOL teaching material based on neurodidactical (Neurodidactics is a relatively young research field that combines the findings of brain research, pedagogy, cognitive psychology and other related fields.) principles for informatics and cross-curricular cooperation from primary school up to University. On the basis of the developed material the following main research questions of the project shall be examined in the course of the next school year: (1) Can COoperative Open Learning methods help to enhance learning? (2) Can learning be enhanced by considering neurodidactical principles in the design of teaching material and in the classroom? As the first test phase of the developed material is still in progress the evaluation is not available at the moment. But the first informal feedback of a vocational school and a programming course at the University shows that it is worth fostering COoperative Open Learning and cross-curricular cooperation.</ab>

        <ab>This essay reviews the principles motivating contemporary critical mathematics discourses. Drawing from varied critical discourses including ethno-mathematics, critical theory, post-structural theory, and situated and ecological cognition, the essay examines the pragmatics of critiques to the privileged role of school mathematics in the era of globalization. Critiques of modern school curricula argue that globalization practices linking education to technological and economic development are increasing, and the curriculum is being re-defined through discourses of privatization, national standards, and global competitiveness. Globalization has reinforced the utilitarian approach to school mathematics and the Western bias in the prevailing mathematics curricula, as well as helped to globalize pervasive mathematical ideologies. In most instances, a newfound status that mathematics is enjoying in this era of globalization is not well deserved, as school mathematics can no longer be considered culturally, socially, politically, nor economically neutral. In particular, school mathematics is increasingly critiqued as a cultural homogenizing force, a critical filter for status, a perpetuator of mistaken illusions of certainty, and an instrument of power. With such concerns it is becoming more evident that mathematics learning and education have implications for building just and democratic societies. As an African female scholar who is now living in Canada, I reflect on what the critical stance might mean for contexts with which I am familiar. I discuss the challenges of school mathematics with a view to improving curriculum and pedagogy so as to raise the awareness of teachers and learners to the questionable assumptions from which mathematics derives its prestige. The mathematics curriculum is central to cultivating values as well as fostering the conscientization of learners. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>Just as science education is too often limited to the acquisition of facts, technology education is too often limited to proficient use of technology. Neither of these goals fully realize a robust definition of science and technology literacy. To achieve greater science and technology literacy, students must understand the natures of both science and technology (NOST). Through understanding NOST, students can make better-informed personal decisions and participate in critical cultural discourse about the role of science and technology in our lives. This article provides ideas about what students should know about NOST and strategies for engaging students with these difficult ideas.</ab>

        <ab>Part of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' 1997 yearbook on multicultural and gender equity in the math classroom.  The writer recommends culturally responsive educational practices to improve African-American students' mathematics achievement.  Solid, culturally responsive pedagogy is predicated on the math teacher being able to interpret, understand, and recognize the students' culture and to integrate this culture into the learning process.</ab>

        <ab>This paper outlines an initial learning progression for the use of evidence to support scientific arguments in the context of decision-making. Use of evidence is a central feature of knowledge evaluation and, therefore, of argumentation. The proposal is based on the literature on argumentation and use of evidence in decision-making contexts. The objective is to develop a construct map describing a trajectory of evidence use in a decision-making context. The levels in the initial learning progression are characterised by studentsâ performance in practice. The framework is applied to a multiple-case study in 10th grade (66 students), structured around a marine resource management task. Data included audio and video recordings, as well as studentsâ written artefacts. Five levels of complexity in student performance are described; on the lowest level, students are able to identify and extract information in response to a problem and recognise general features in a set of data; on the uppermost level, they are able to articulate arguments by synthesising evidence from multiple sources and evaluate options based on evidence and scientific content. The framework also shows potential for recognising studentsâ difficulties in identifying and integrating data and evidence in their justifications and in drawing from domain knowledge to interpret evidence. Implications for educational practice are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Generalizing or making claims that extend beyond particular situations is a central mathematical practice and a focus of classroom mathematics instruction. This study examines how aspects of generality are produced through the situated activities of a group of middle school mathematics students working on an 8-week population-modeling project. The project involved creating and analyzing mathematical models of population growth. Two classroom episodes are presented that focus on students' activities across curricular tasks in which they discuss the category of sensible models of population growth and describe a pattern of guppy population growth in a natural environment. Participation frameworks introduced in the context of the episodes describe how students compare situations to determine if they belong to the same general category and predict and justify the behavior of modeled phenomena. The analysis suggests that mathematical generalizing is the outcome of processes distributed across students, tasks, embodied activity, and modeling tools.</ab>

        <ab>This study focuses on a professional development program for science teachers near or on American Indian reservations in Montana. This program was framed by culturally relevant pedagogy premises and was characterized by instructional strategies and content foci resulting from the intersection between three cultures: tribal, science teaching, and science. The study employs a quasi-experimental design and quantitative methods to examine the impact of the program on teachers' practice and beliefs, and to determine the relationship between student-centered equity-focused instruction and students' science test score gains. Results of the analyses indicate that after 2 years in the program teachers changed their teaching practices and beliefs about their ability to teach science and to implement equitable instruction in a way that positively impacted students' performance. Using a multiple regression analysis it was found that gains in teacher beliefs about their ability to implement equitable strategies and the increase of teaching strategies that prompt students to make connections between science and their real-life issues significantly explained the 36.7% of the variance of student science test scores gains in treatment classrooms. No significant changes in beliefs or teaching strategies were found for comparison teachers. The results obtained from this study contribute to the identification of characteristics of a professional development program that positively impacted the science teaching of American Indian students.

        <ab>Part of a special section on learning, teaching, and educational administration.  The potential influence of opportunity-to-learn standards on the mathematics education of African-American students was examined.  Opportunity to learn has been defined as the amount of time allocated to the learner for the learning of a specific task, and four variables related to teacher instructional practice and student learning have consistently emerged in its interpretation:  content coverage, content exposure, content emphasis, and the quality of instructional delivery.  Findings suggest that African-American students' opportunity-to-learn standards should be built on the rapid growth and changes in mathematics, constructivist principles of learning, the concept of fiscal adequacy in urban schools, and cultural factors that influence mathematics learning.</ab>

        <ab>The 100s chart can help students to become proficient in mental mathematics.  Children can use cube trains to solve mathematical problems, and they can then progress to the 100s chart to solve harder problems.  The strength of the visual imagery that is furnished by the chart enables students to move rather quickly to carry out most calculations mentally.  Students can be challenged to describe and justify the patterns they discover on the chart and be encouraged to apply these patterns.</ab>

Analyzing case study data on two children from low-income families in financially deprived areas, a study examined reasons for the low mathematics achievement of children from low socioeconomic backgrounds in Great Britain.  Results revealed that school played a marginal role in the low mathematics achievement of these students.  Although actively engaged in numeracy practices at home, schooling contributed to their roles as disengaged, passive, and outside children in the mathematics classroom.  Other results and implications of the study are discussed.</ab>

The author provides in-depth descriptions of cogenerative dialogues, coteaching, and cosmopolitanism (3Cs), and presents this triad of tools as an approach to research/practice that addresses full participation of youth in an urban physics classroom. By describing the 3Cs, in an urban classroom, the author presents under-discussed issues that inhibit urban youth from fully participating in urban science classrooms, as an inhibitor to social justice within the classroom.</ab>

        <ab>The literature on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is abounding with the importance of increasing college access, retention, and persistence among students because of implications for America's global competitiveness. Particular emphasis has been placed on college students of color who remain underrepresented in STEM education. Therefore, increasing college access, retention, and persistence for students of color in STEM is not merely a matter of United States' economic competitiveness, but also a matter of equity. Using in-depth interview methods, this article delineates factors facilitating the retention and persistence of students of color in STEM education at a predominantly White institution. Implications for institutional practice and research are provided.</ab>

        <ab>Part of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' 1997 yearbook on multicultural and gender equity in the math classroom.  The writers discuss two ways in which ethnomathematics can become a tool for use in the mathematics classroom.  The two ways are for students to regard ethnomathematics as the mathematics practice of others and as their own mathematics practice.  By encouraging students to do mathematics that uses both others' mathematics practices and their own, math educators can assist students in making connections, developing deeper mathematical understandings, and expanding their beliefs about what mathematics is.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special issue on mathematics education in the context of reform.  A review of policy documents and research to explore equity in mathematics education is presented.  The review focuses on past standards documents and their treatment of equity issues, on equity-based critiques of the standards, and on research outlining strategies for accomplishing equity in mathematics education.  The review shows that three aspects of education that affect underrepresented students' success in mathematics are structural aspects of school districts, beliefs about diverse students and mathematics learning, and classroom processes.  The review also shows that a combination of high-quality curriculum materials, pedagogical strategies, assessment, and professional development based on the standards documents is necessary but not sufficient for achieving equity.  Steps for accomplishing equitable mathematics education are presented.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special issue on the context of urban education and attempts to redefine the meanings and definitions of its challenges and successes in the name of social justice and long-term change.  A study investigated the impact of collective teacher beliefs and practices in a high school mathematics department on the success of Latino/a students in the subject.  Results revealed that teacher collectivity enabled teachers to develop meaningful relationships with their students.  These relationships underlie teachers' ability to advance large numbers of students to calculus by their senior year.  Other results of the study, the implications of the study, and recommendations for future research are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>State assessments are taking over our classrooms. This study provides a descriptive account of how the testing culture affected students and instruction during one school year in two small, rural Mississippi secondary mathematics classrooms. Throughout this school year, engaging instructional activities were sacrificed for more traditional drill and practice lessons aligned specifically with the end-of-the-year assessments. Curriculum was limited and teaching to the test was emphasized, especially during the weeks just prior to the assessments. Students found the assessments to be motivational, but like the instructor, students experienced pressures associated with these tests. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the emotional responses of three individuals to timed mathematics tests.  We examine the emotional responses of two adult women who look back to timed skills-tests in elementary school and the emotional response of a grade-three girl currently taking timed skills-tests.  To interpret the individual reactions, we use a non-Newtonian view of time and draw on Mandler's insights into the nature of emotional responses.  We examine the implications of these emotional responses for equitable assessment practices.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>This edition of the journal of Teacher Development represents a wide diversity of perspectives on teaching, learning and education, ranging from those involved in initial teacher education to those of established teachers and researchers; it encompasses the primary, secondary, further education and higher education sectors and has contributors from Australia, Malawi, Finland, Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK). But the overwhelming impression as you read through is not of difference, but similarity: the shared interest in developing practice, a determination to bring about change through evidence gained from research rather than political demands, and a desire to make genuine and ongoing professional development (as opposed to the ''day course'' syndrome) a reality for all those involved in education.The narrative line in the journal is linear: Hayes begins with a discussion on primary initial teacher training and the need to acknowledge and act upon a well-known but rarely formally acknowledged phenomenon: the emotional demands made on trainees entering teaching. It is sometimes easy to underestimate the significance of these demands on trainees. One trainee''s eloquent description might give us an insight:this time last year I was six hours away from making my marriage vows. I honestly think I am more nervous now than I was then!Those involved in initial teacher training will have had the experience of trainees at emotional meltdown, and know too well how easily their confidence can be damaged by demanding early teaching experiences. Hayes''s research demonstrates clearly that training can only be enhanced by understanding trainees'' emotional needs: ''The development ... of trainee teachers'' emotional literacy is an essential element of their preparation and too important to be left to chance''.Aubusson gives us another perspective on those entering the profession - not least with the simple contrast of terms. We ''train'' teachers in the UK: Australia ''educates'' them. That in itself is probably worth a paper. Aubusson takes us on an absorbing journey looking at a secondary teacher education programme which, whilst successful, was nevertheless suffering from the endemic problems of fragmentation and the concomitant student perceptions of the ''relevance to schools'' issue. His account is not a pat set of ''recommendations'' but an invitation to readers to engage with a story ''rich enough in detail about the context and challenges encountered to allow readers to make their own determination about what is familiar, what rings true and what might inform other teacher development programmes''.In the third article dealing with trainee teachers, Avis, Bathmaker, Kendal and Parsons look at the context of teacher training in further education (in the UK, post-compulsory education colleges) and the constructions of critical pedagogy and learning. The exploration of critical pedagogy and the trainee teachers'' responses, conceptualised through an exploration of constructions of ''good'' and ''bad'', whether with lecturers, recalling an earlier project or specifically with trainee teachers and their construction of students, asks us to think below the surface and to consider that engaging with pedagogic practices demands we recognise that ''[pedagogy] incorporates a critical understanding of the social, policy and institutional context, as well as a critical approach to the content and process of the educational/training transaction''. The implications drawn for teacher training are significant for all involved.Recruitment and retention are inextricably linked these days. In the UK, 30% of teachers will leave in or shortly after their third year of teaching. It''s a statistic echoed elsewhere in the world. Understanding teachers'' thinking in their third year is therefore of great importance if we are to address the loss to the profession. Hammond and Cartwright''s article is particularly useful in understanding the ''third year in'', not least because we are able to track these same teachers through the articles published by Hammond in this journal as a sequenced account of coming to terms with teaching. This group, a cohort trained as secondary information and communications technology teachers, gives us some powerful insights into the crucial third year, in terms of their own personal development as teachers, of the ways in which school management is pivotal in defining satisfaction in teaching - and what experiences underpin decisions to leave the profession.And once we are there - established in teaching and committed to staying - what then? If one of the characteristics of a profession is self-knowledge and improvement, then the following articles all point us towards teaching as a profession.Dinham and Scott explore the development of a professional portfolio in the context of an award in Australia for ''quality'' teaching, which required the development of a portfolio as part of the evidence for that award. Dinham and Scott investigate, through case studies, the impact of building such portfolios on professional and personal development. Although not originally conceived of as a professional development activity, the case studies demonstrate clearly that the act of building such a document is in itself extremely influential. One teacher reported: ''the greatest learning from the process happened with the portfolio. To sit back and reflect on 20 years of teaching, the significant people in that time and the reasons for doing what I do was a very powerful exercise. It highlighted for me the journey of growth professionally and personally''. As Dinham and Scott say, there are implications here for the introduction of such a portfolio early in teachers'' careers.Donnelly also looks at the use of teaching portfolios, but in the context of higher education teaching in Ireland. She makes the point that many professions already use portfolios as ''histories'' but that in teaching, the critical component is that of reflection. Donnelly outlines the ways in which her particular institution went about developing the professional portfolio, introducing and structuring the notion around the four stages of experiential learning underpinning the course in question, a Postgraduate Certificate in Third Level Learning and Teaching. She ends with the interesting proposal that the next stage might be an e-portfolio, not simply for convenience, but because access to representation through hypertext would allow a portfolio to move beyond the limitations of printed, linear texts to representation of professional thinking ''in action''.The last three articles exemplify the ways in which experienced teachers and researchers think about education. It is, as it were, the final narrative sequence of this issue of the journal.Kaphesi offers a fascinating insight into the relationship between language and mathematical thinking in the context of primary teaching of mathematics in Malawi, where language policy on the use of the ''official'' language, English, or of the national and local language, Chichewa, impacts directly on the teaching of mathematics. In particular, Kaphesi demonstrates the tensions caused by the policy which insists that English textbooks are used by teachers, but that workbooks for pupils are written in Chichewa. The resulting need to translate mathematical terms and mathematical concepts from English to Chichewa, where sometimes direct parallels do not exist, damages teaching and learning alike. Arguing that the basis for effective teaching lies in a constructivist approach, Kaphesi argues cogently for attention to language policy as a key area for the improvement of mathematics teaching in Malawi.Whitehead challenges us to think again about boys and achievement. As she points out in her title, we seem to be dealing with a paradox. Present evidence seems to point toward the notion of boys'' academic success being based upon extrinsic motivation. Indeed, many of the present UK government documents on underachieving boys use this as a basis for the guidelines given to bring about academic success. However, Whitehead presents a convincing case for the significance of intrinsic motivation in bringing about boys'' academic success and claims further that this feature cuts across many of the other factors (for example, social class) which were assumed to be key in understanding boys'' success. She further goes on to demonstrate that a quite unexplored aspect in this debate - the adherence to traditional sex roles - is a key indicator of success in boys - certainly a new perspective for legislators to consider.Finally, Husu draws our attention to the question of professional ethics. This is not an ''ivory tower'' idea but a real issue in everyday teaching and research in education. As he observes, teachers and students are both bound by certain values inherent in the education system, but that is not to suggest that we are without choice, and it is here that we begin to recognise that choices in education are often based on subjective interpretations of a situation. Using the case of teachers being asked to discipline students caught smoking just outside school grounds, Husu elegantly demonstrates the differing ways teachers tackle the problem and the ethical positions they thereby adopt, even though they themselves simply believe they are acting ''practically''. The implications Husu draws out are for the need to move away from preset rules for allowed behaviour to a dialectic which allows multiple understandings and therefore multiple possibilities for resolution, and ultimately, individuals who are self-motivated in making effective learning choices.So a diversity of articles, of geography and of phases, but a commonality of concerns: understanding and making effective teaching and learning - a truly global theme.Sue Brindley &amp; Michelle SelingerCo-Editors</ab>

        <ab>Prospective secondary mathematics teachers lack images of âreformedâ teaching that engages students in experimenting, analyzing, conjecturing, justifying, and making connections. The development and investigation of experiences fostering reform-oriented teaching are needed. This study investigated microteaching lesson study (MLS), an experience based on the successful Japanese lesson study. A qualitative analysis of various data sources was conducted, demonstrating the learning and perceptions of 36 prospective mathematics teachers engaged in MLS. Overall, the prospective teachers found the experience to be very beneficial. Beyond providing teaching experience, the MLS facilitated enhancement of their understanding of reform-oriented teaching and knowledge of subject matter through collaboration with peers and feedback from an instructor.

        <ab>Part of a special issue on the content and effect of the new national math and science standards.  The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics math standards generally emphasize what is mathematically important and represent a serious attempt to create a culture of doing math in the classroom.  The overall framework is good, particularly if it continues to be revised and if those in charge of revision listen seriously to mathematicians and educators with diverse perspectives. However, there are some problems with content emphasis and with method.  There are also places where the documents could have been written with more care, less ambiguity, and less bias.  Moreover, confusing standards documents with other reform documents, various interpretations of reform, and classroom practices justified in the name of reform have muddied the math standards debate.</ab>

        <ab>Teaching is a critical consideration in investigations of primary school leadership and not just as an outcome variable. Factoring in instruction as an explanatory variable in scholarship on school leadership involves moving away from views of teaching as a monolithic or unitary practice. When it comes to leadership in primary schools, the subject matters. More sophisticated constructions of teaching are necessary that take into account the subject matter (e.g. mathematics or literacy) and the dimension of teaching (e.g. content and teaching strategies). This paper explores how the practice of leadership in primary schools is structured differently depending on the school subject.</ab>

Sample:The participants were 171 pre-service physics teachers recruited from two universities: 86 from University A and 85 from University B. Design and method:Participants were prompted to develop a written argument to either support or challenge the Turkish governmentâs decision to invest in nuclear power plants. Data consist of written arguments developed by the participants and information on participantsâ knowledge of the topic, their confidence in their knowledge and the source of their knowledge related to the topic. Data were analyzed using the CER framework. Results:The results show that participants did not perform at the expected level. The majority of students failed to develop strong scientific arguments. While almost all of the participants provided evidence to justify their claims, they failed to effectively coordinate evidence, claim and theory to develop an argument. Students struggled the most in the warrant/reasoning category of the CER framework. We also identified several misconceptions that students held related to nuclear power plants. Conclusions:In our discussion we problematize college science teaching and advocate integration of instructional strategies such as argumentation that can effectively engage students in construction, evaluation and justification of knowledge.</ab>

        <ab>Just as the new curricula, teaching methods, and testing practices for mathematics are beginning to be tested in schools and universities across America and are starting to show positive signs, critics have challenged the content goals, academic principals, and assessment practices at the heart of the reform agenda.  In light of ardent resistance from some dissenting mathematicians, teachers, and other citizens, there appears to be a real risk that many schools will decline opportunities for much-required improvement in mathematics education.  They may instead choose to stay with comfortable and traditional curricula, teaching, and assessment strategies that have proved inadequate.  The writers reevaluate the case for change in mathematics education and examine the protests of critics in light of recent research and evaluation evidence.</ab>

        <ab>The study referred to in this article adopted a dialogic approach, putting the voices of experienced teachers and supervisors into the form of a dialogue in order to examine how both parties perceive, enact and justify their pedagogical practices in actual school settings. Various sets of data were utilised, including interviews, classroom observations and a post-observation conference with Saudi EFL teachers and supervisors. The findings demonstrate that teachers and supervisors all occupy different positions in the school hierarchy in the TESOL landscape, depending on the ï¿½typeï¿½ as well as ï¿½amount of capitalï¿½ they possess. Specifically, although some supervisors continue to believe that their accumulated experience, including teaching credentials, supervision and administrative experience, outweighs the academic and scientific capital of teachers, teachers also claim that their accumulated experience of several years of teaching, their EFL qualifications and training, their knowledge of ground realities in school settings and their experience of two different national educational systems have enabled and legitimised them to devise their own classroom practices. It is therefore concluded that supervisors should re-conceptualise their roles, challenge their own assumptions and be willing to engage in continuous critical discussions with the teachers. Both parties conduct their pedagogical practice with strong sense of agency/engagement. This study argues that these forms of agency in language teaching need further scholarly attention, for ï¿½they are inherently contextual and dialogic, in that they have a history and a present that resides in an ongoing negotiated state of intense and essential axiological interactionï¿½.</ab>

        <ab>Social work programs are increasingly relying on study abroad to prepare students for global practice. A growing body of literature reports on the positive features of international education, yet little attention has been focused on preparing social work programs and the faculty who lead them to handle the emergencies that can arise during study abroad. This paper uses a case study of an actual emergency in a study abroad program to examine how the event was handled and to assess its short- and long-term consequences. Elements of the case are analyzed in an effort to identify general issues for study abroad programs to consider.</ab>

        <ab>This article justifies classifying the TI-Nspire CAS Touchpad as a mobile device for grades 8-16 mathematics classrooms equipped with a Navigator system. The 2010 Horizon Report: K-12 indicates virtually every secondary school aged child has some sort of mobile device. Yet, many school policies ban the use of mobile devices, preventing students from using these devices in an educational setting. Further, some teachers have been slow to adopt and use mobile devices to advance the educational setting of their classroom to a 21 century classroom. A classroom equipped with wireless Navigator technology and students equipped with Nspire handhelds presents an engaging 21 century mathematics classroom for all learners. These classrooms present a happy-medium wireless communication setup that prevents students from communicating with each other or browsing the web. Students can instantly communicate with the teacher and vice-verse. Students stay on task while using a mobile device.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the use of a digital video annotation tool used by beginning in-service secondary science and mathematics teachers in the Teacher Induction Network (TIN). TIN is an online induction program in its ninth year of existence and has served over 180 teachers. The need to provide spaces for beginning teachers to reflect on their practice and seek support of their colleagues is critical to their professional growth. The current study specifically examines the social interactions and potential supports of a video annotation tool (VideoANT) to promote collaborative interactions toward the development of reflective practices. Results suggest that in the absence of additional scaffolding, teachers overwhelmingly used VideoANT to respond to their peers' teaching practices with praise and agreement. Given the aims and objectives of the induction course, this finding indicates the need to give beginning teachers specific supports and scaffolds to further their development as reflective practitioners. This study adds to the literature on online video clubs for teacher education and identifies changes intended to improve the current design of the video activity in TIN.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special issue on reading and writing across the curriculum. The language-mathematics connection offers positive new ways of thinking about mathematics education.  Both active literacy and the natural learning environment, which have proved to be powerful tools in changing attitudes and practice in the fields of language arts, can work just as well in math, if properly understood and adapted.  Active literacy is a process that enables learners to go much deeper than the coding and encoding of written symbols, and those who are to achieve active mathematical literacy must solve meaningful problems related to real-world contexts.  All natural learning environments hold that the natural motivation of the child is of prime importance in structuring learning experiences.  Five principles that reinforce the importance of the language-mathematics connection are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Around the world we hear considerable talk about creating world-class schools. Usually the term refers to schools whose students get very high scores on the international comparisons of student achievement such as PISA or TIMSS. The practice of restricting the meaning of exemplary schools to the narrow criterion of achievement scores is usually premised on the view that test scores are closely linked to the provision of a capable labour force and competitive economy. In fact, the measured relationships between test scores and earnings or productivity are modest and explain a relatively small share of the larger link between educational attainment and economic outcomes. What has been omitted from such narrow assessments are the effects that education has on the development of interpersonal and intrapersonal skills and capabilities that affect the quality and productivity of the labour force. This article provides evidence on some of these relationships, on the degree to which the non-cognitive effects of schooling contribute to adult performance, and on the evidence that deliberate school interventions can influence non-cognitive outcomes. It concludes with the view that the quest for world-class schools must encompass a range of human development characteristics that extend considerably beyond test scores.</ab>

        <ab>Proving is an activity which occurs only implicitly in the UK school mathematics curriculum:  the present advice is for pupils to engage in personal investigations and problem solving so as to promote process skills such as conjecturing, generalizing, and justifying.  This article describes the proof practices of a sample of year 10 pupils. The evidence indicates that a few pupils were able to justify accessible statements using logical arguments and that the type and structure of the mathematical activities in the classroom may need to be changed in order to motivate all pupils to justify by logical reasoning rather than by empirical evidence.

        <ab>A mathematical activity called Incredible Equations is considered. Each day, the teacher adds the current date to a calendar that the class is creating, and students spend between 10 and 20 minutes generating numerical expressions equal in value to the date.  The students call out their numerical expressions as the teacher writes them on the board.  The teacher then repeats the equation step by step as the students justify their own work.  Examples of how the students in a class learned from one another and invented their own methods of mental computation, of many of the equations created by the students, and of the connections between the mathematics encountered in the activity and the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics are provided.</ab>

        <ab>Two previous articles in this journal advocate the greater use of a behaviourist methodology called 'Precision Teaching' (PT). From a position located within virtue ethics, this article argues that the technical feat of raising narrowly defined performance in mathematics and other subjects is not sufficient justification for the extensive use of behaviourist techniques such as this. The article uses ideas drawn from ancient Egyptian mythology as well as some more familiar Greek philosophy, to raise broader questions about the wisdom of relying too heavily on technical rationality in present-day educational practice. The polemical intent is to dismiss unreflective behaviourism and to offer a brief glimpse of a very new educational paradigm: 'navigationism'.</ab>

        <ab>The advance in new technologies has changed the educational model considerably. On-line education has arrived with a bang at university and those degree courses linked to the field of communication have adopted this type of technologies. In just a few years, the number of courses available in the communication field that include on-line subjects has multiplied. It seems that this tendency of proliferation will continue due to a high demand for degrees in the communication field as well as the possibility of completing these degrees on-line. This paper shows the perspective that on-line journalism students at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid have on their studies. The results of a survey of students of the different courses that include the qualification allow us to gain a perspective of their experiences at the beginning and end of the studies. The questionnaire asks about socio-demographic traits from which we draw a sociological profile of on-line journalism student. It also delves into the motivations and expectations surrounding the decision to enrol in this mode and in its assessment both in terms of learning and the relationship between peers and teachers. Some of the conclusions point to the positive attitude of students and a satisfactory evaluation by the students.</ab>

Articles discuss the concept of race reflection in cultural contexts; the development of cultural critical consciousness and self-reflection in preservice teacher education; a model for reflection based around the intersection of cultural diversity, reflective teaching, and moral value; theoretical and practical considerations for critical reflection and culturally relevant teaching for teacher education; what a group of teacher education graduates learned about race as they prepared to teach in multiracial classrooms; equity in school mathematics; the underrepresentation of diverse students in gifted programs and steps that can be taken to address this underrepresentation; a mentoring triad involving a first-year African-American teacher, her mentor, and her principal; the importance of technology for making cultural values visible; one English teacher's practice of reflection in a suburban, predominantly white, middle-class high school; and teacher learning as praxis.  An annotated directory of resources for classroom use is also provided.</ab>

        <ab>This chapter describes the evaluation of the TsunamiReadyâ¢-based educational materials distributed in New Hanover County, North Carolina. The authors evaluate whether educational materials about tsunami risk increased the perception of hazard risk, information, knowledge, and preparedness behaviors. There are three main findings. First, local knowledge of regional hazards remains a strong predictor of changes in attitudes and behavior. Second, educational materials about unlikely hazards have only a moderate impact. Third, information seeking and preparedness behavior is a function of general psychological attributes such as personal risk calculations. The authors argue that a community's hazard experiences and the frequency and severity of hazard events play an important role in receptiveness to educational efforts as well as disaster preparedness.

        <ab>This article presents a mathematical analysis of factor rings over the Gaussian integers. Specifically, the authors generalize the idea of factor rings from the integers to the Gaussian integers and discuss what new objects can be found in this manner. The Gaussian integers sit inside complex numbers and thus obey the usual rules of addition and multiplication; indeed, despite the presence of imaginary function, they are quite similar to the "traditional" integers. In fact, one can define Gaussian integer primes, construct analogues of the Euclidean division algorithm and the Euler function, discuss Pythagorean triples, generalize the twin-prime problem, and much more. If the Gaussian integers were no more than a practice area for generalizing concepts from the standard integers, they would still be of great interest to students and researchers alike. Yet these numbers have been and still are far more than just a convenient teaching tool. They have played roles in the development of two of the great theorems of mathematics of the last two centuries--the reciprocity theorems and Fermat's Last Theorem--and have helped inspire the creation of algebraic number theory.</ab>

        <ab>Mathematical operation signs contrast sharply with the intuitive view of children and intuitive learning practices and are inconsistent, ungrammatical, and ambiguous.  Some children's inability to grasp mathematical concepts may be due to their reluctance to move from their intuitive method of understanding numbers to this untried and potentially problematic mathematical system.</ab>

        <ab>In this design study, the authors documented means by which preservice teachers experienced mathematics and science associated with understanding the Moon and sky as they participated in project work within their mathematics and science methods course. The authors examined the way preservice teachers applied mathematics needed to accomplish project tasks in an astronomical context and compared project work of 6 groups. The groups experienced difficulties applying basic mathematics such as scaling, ratios, and sine curves, requiring just-in-time scaffolding lessons to facilitate project progress. In their analysis of participants' pre- and post-scientific and mathematical understandings needed to grasp lunar concepts, authors found that preservice teachers made significant gains in both areas.

        <ab>This article discusses how multimodal learning encourages teachers to show their students how to look at multiple forms of text to examine what it means to their identities and to their thoughts about the world. The article attempts to deconstruct the myth that literacy is unrelated to social studies, math, and science courses. A sociocultural view is presented to redefine literacy and to view it as more than just reading and writing. A group content lesson is evaluated, which presented multiple perspectives on the War in Iraq from graduate students in the departments of English, drama, math, music and economics.</ab>

        <ab>In classrooms from kindergarten to graduate school, researchers have identified target students as students who monopolize material and human resources. Classroom structures that privilege the voice and actions of target students can cause divisive social dynamics that may generate cliques. This study focuses on the emergence of target students, the formation of cliques, and professors' efforts to mediate teacher learning in a Master of Science in Chemistry Education (MSCE) program by structuring the classroom environment to enhance nontarget students' agency. Specifically, we sought to answer the following question: What strategies could help college science professors enact more equitable teaching structures in their classrooms so that target students and cliques become less of an issue in classroom interactions? The implications for professional education programs in science and mathematics include the need for professors to consider the role and contribution of target students to the learning environment, the need to structure an equitable learning environment, and the need to foster critical reflection upon classroom interactions between students and instructors.

        <ab>Suggestions for ensuring gender equity in the classroom are presented. Girls begin to lose confidence and optimism during adolescence.  When their self-esteem drops, their achievement suffers and they opt out of challenging courses such as math and science.  Teachers should communicate the message that it is good to be clever and assertive, give girls constructive feedback, wait longer for girls to answer in class, and create a learning atmosphere free of unwanted sexual remarks.  School counselors should encourage girls to sign up for and persist with demanding courses and encourage them to become involved in sports and other activities.  Parents should have high academic expectations for their daughters and should limit television on school nights.  School principals can lead the way in ensuring that girls are treated equally in school.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The emergence of a participatory culture, brought about mainly by the use of Web2.0 technology, is challenging us to reconsider aspects of teaching and learning. Adapting the learning-as-digital-game-building approach, this paper explores how new educational practices can help students build skills for the 21st century. Purpose: This paper examines elementary students' learning experiences through digital game building and playing. The following research questions guided the study: (1) What emotions do students experience during the process of building digital games for others to use?; (2) What traits do students display when they learn through digital game-building?; and (3) What do students learn from the digital game-building experience? Sample: The participants were 21 elementary students (19 boys and two girls), aged between seven and 11, who were on a summer camp at a university in Canada. Design and methods: This small-scale study made use of enactivism (Li, Clark, and Winchester, Instructional design and technology grounded in enactivism: A paradigm shift?, British Journal of Educational Technology 41, no. 3: 403-419, 2010), a new theoretical framework, as a basis for analysing the students' experiences and responses as they created computer games to teach others the concept of Issac Newton's Three Laws of Motion. Quantitative and qualitative data collected included student and parent surveys, teacher and student interviews, field observations and the digital games created by the students. Data were subjected to quantitative and thematic analyses. Results: The results indicated that only a small minority of students reported never feeling the positive emotions excited/happy or smart/proud during the process of building digital games. In addition, analysis suggested that creativity, engagement and new identity were the three salient traits displayed by the students when learning by digital game-building. There was also evidence that students increased their understanding of the subject matter in question (mathematics, science and technology) and enhanced their general problem-solving abilities through the process. Conclusions: This small-scale study suggests that student engagement in the game-building experience can enhance not just the learning of the game design process but also subject matter and generic skills. Thus, the learning-as-building approach can empower students to âtake over the technologyâ and become creators rather than passive consumers. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>Just as scientific knowledge is constructed using distinct modes of inquiry (e.g. experimental or historical), arguments constructed during science instruction may vary depending on the mode of inquiry underlying the topic. The purpose of this study was to examine whether and how secondary science teachers construct scientific arguments during instruction differently for topics that rely on experimental or historical modes of inquiry. Four experienced high-school science teachers were observed daily during instructional units for both experimental and historical science topics. The main data sources include classroom observations and teacher interviews. The arguments were analyzed using Toulmin's argumentation pattern revealing specific patterns of arguments in teaching topics relying on these 2 modes of scientific inquiry. The teachers presented arguments to their students that were rather simple in structure but relatively authentic to the 2 different modes. The teachers used far more evidence in teaching topics based on historical inquiry than topics based on experimental inquiry. However, the differences were implicit in their teaching. Furthermore, their arguments did not portray the dynamic nature of science. Very few rebuttals or qualifiers were provided as the teachers were presenting their claims as if the data led straightforward to the claim. Implications for classroom practice and research are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' Assessment Standards for School Mathematics (1995) is designed to help evaluate the nature, purposes, quality, and appropriateness of mathematics assessments.  The document presents standards for six areas of concern that define criteria for judging the quality of mathematics assessments.  These criteria can be used by individual teachers who are working to improve their abilities to evaluate diverse student performances and use assessment to improve the instructional program, or they may be used by a school committee or district that is looking at the grading policies, the types of assessments used, and the overall effectiveness of the mathematics program.  A set of questions helps teachers to assess the content of the mathematics curriculum, assess student learning, assess the equity of assessment practices, determine whether students are informed about what they are expected to know, make inferences about the assessment that has been carried out, and determine that the phases of the assessment fit together.</ab>

        <ab>Part of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' 1997 yearbook on multicultural and gender equity in the math classroom.  A study explored how students' class backgrounds might influence their mathematical thinking and learning.  Participants were 18 seventh graders of various socioeconomic backgrounds who provided information on their thinking about mathematical claims in the media.  The results are discussed in relation to students' beliefs about the nature of research, students' interpretation of media claims, and the influence of claims.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special section on sex equity in education.  The barriers and stereotypes that limit the options of both sexes must be eliminated to achieve gender equitable education.  In order to attain this goal, schools must recognize the gendered nature of schooling, carefully examine classroom practices, and learn from all-girl settings about teaching methods and curricular approaches that specifically appeal to girls and determine how to use these approaches successfully in mixed-sex classes.  Three frequent suggestions from teachers who work in all-girl settings are placing less emphasis on competition and speed and more stress on working together to ensure that everyone completes and understands the problem or project, placing more emphasis on curricular materials that feature girls and women, and focusing more on practical, real-life applications of mathematics and the sciences.  The ways that these suggestions can be applied in mixed-sex settings are described.</ab>

        <ab>As computer programming and computational thinking (CT) become more integrated into K-12 instruction, content teachers and special educators need to understand how to provide instructional supports to a wide range of learners, including students with disabilities. This cross-case analysis study examined the supports that two students with disabilities, who were initially disengaged during computing activities, received during computing instruction. Data revealed that students' support needs during computing activities were not CT-specific. Rather, supports specific to these students' needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in CT. Although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in CT and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum. We present a framework for evaluating student engagement to identify student-specific supports and, when needed, refine the emerging K-12 CT pedagogy to facilitate full participation of all students. We then offer a list of four implications for practice based on the findings.</ab>

The aim of the research is to compare the effectiveness of three samples of elementary school teachers with different levels of experience and training. Using a multilevel model, the results demonstrate that training enhances the effectiveness of novice teachers, In addition, experience was also found to have a positive effect. Neither training nor experience have a significant effect on equity, defined as the capacity of reducing the initial gap between high and low achieving pupils.</ab>

        <ab>This research study assessed the effectiveness of a three-dimensional mathematics game, DimensionM, through a pretest-posttest control group quasi-experimental design. Participants consisted of 437 eighth graders. The classrooms were randomly assigned either to the treatment group that utilized DimensionM as a supplement to regular classroom instructions or to the control group that received regular class instructions without any computer activities. The results of the analysis on the pretest-posttest data revealed that the DimensionM game increased mathematical knowledge acquisition in algebra and maintained student motivation to learn. The findings suggest that the implementation of DimensionM in mathematics education can greatly benefit middle school students learning algebra. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Evaluations on the effectiveness of instructional games are known in the community of both practitioners and experienced researchers in educational research., What this paper adds This paper specifically added to the literature by evaluating the effectiveness of the novel instructional game, the DimensionM game, on increasing middle school student mathematical knowledge acquisition in algebra and maintaining student motivation to learn., Implications for practice and/or policy The study results suggested that the implementation of DimensionM in mathematics education can benefit middle school students' learning of algebra and can be helpful to maintain their motivation in learning.</ab>

        <ab>A study was conducted to examine the views of students in an introductory statistics class regarding probability.  Findings indicated that students were generally confused about the classical, frequency, and subjective ideas of probability.  Whereas the students were capable of solving stylized classical probability problems, they were likely to assume that experimental results were just as likely even when such an assumption was inappropriate.</ab>

        <ab>What does it mean to understand a physics equation?  The use of formal expressions in physics is not just a matter of the rigorous and routinized application of principles, followed by the formal manipulation of expressions to obtain an answer.  Rather, successful students learn to understand what equations say in a fundamental sense; they have a feel for expressions, and this guides their work. More specifically, students learn to understand physics equations in terms of a vocabulary of elements that I call symbolic forms.  Each symbolic form associates a simple conceptual schema with a pattern of symbols in an equation.  This hypothesis has implications for how we should understand what must be taught and learned in physics classrooms.  From the point of view of improving instruction, it is absolutely critical to acknowledge that physics expertise involves this more flexible and generative understanding of equations, and our instruction should be geared toward helping students to acquire this understanding.  The work described here is based on an analysis of a corpus of videotapes in which university students solve physics problems.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special issue on the results of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).  The writers outline what SciMath, Minnesota's statewide coalition focusing on standards-based systemic reform in math and science education, is learning from the TIMSS results on Minnesota.  The TIMSS results indicate that Minnesota students scored well in science but only average in math.  Although the grades are good, there are areas, such as gender equity and score variability, that are less than satisfactory.  Moreover, the TIMSS results offer SciMath contextual information about textbooks, curricula, teaching practices, and student and teacher attitudes.</ab>

        <ab>Action research is defined as using research activities to develop concrete societal practices. Action research understands the change of practice as being already a central aim of the research process itself, and it also seeks to contribute to the professional development of all participants in the particular field of study. Even though (or maybe even because) action research has a long history in the literature, there is a wide variety of interpretations of it. These range all the way from research supportive, via interactive, to emancipatory approaches. There is also a broad range of objectives covering both improving professional environments and generating results of general interest. This paper explores the spectrum of justifications given for action research with a specific focus on science education. Two completely different examples of action research selected from Israel and Germany help illustrate the diversity of the topic. The Israeli case focuses primarily on the professional development of a group of teachers; the German example hones in on the development of suitable curricula and lesson plans for wide dissemination. Comparison of these two projects is embedded in a theoretical framework which categorizes the different action research modes and contemplates teachers' professional development. The aim of this paper is to reflect upon the common potential inherent in differing forms of action research on science education, including the aspect of professional development among teachers.</ab>

        <ab>In an effort to reduce failure and attrition rates and to increase on-time program completion and graduation rates, many schools are adopting a policy of assigning minimum grades. While justifications supporting the policy are often mathematical in nature, some proponents also claim the practice works to keep students motivated, hopeful, confident and optimistic. This paper explores these claims by comparing the stated reasons for grading practices and policies against several theories of learning and the secondary effects grades have on students. Key concepts from the models of achievement motivation, locus of control and self-efficacy, as well as consideration of the nature of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, lead to conclusions that there may be certain sub-populations of students who could benefit greatly from minimum grading practices and policies, particularly in certain (âhigh-riskâ) courses and subject-matters. Ways to identify these students, courses and subject matters are presented and discussed, as are the general outlines of the formal exploratory and confirmatory studies that are needed to clarify and more precisely answer the several questions about minimum grading policies identified in this paper.

        <ab>ABSTRACT This study investigated how student participation in an authentic scientific investigation may shape underrepresented students' views of science and support students in learning science. The research centered on the instructional approach used in a fifth-grade classroom to engage English language learning students from Latino backgrounds in a geological investigation using Devonian fossils. The teacher combined the use of inquiry with multicultural education strategies and explicit instruction in nature of science. The unique combination of these instructional strategies, which we refer to as 'multicultural inquiry,' provided students with opportunities for experiencing scientific activities and negotiating their understandings about scientific culture. Through this instructional approach, students demonstrated science learning and also came to view science as (1) more than just a subject at school, (2) different from media-based depictions, and (3) aligned with the actual disciplines of geology and paleontology. Students also demonstrated self-identification with scientists and interest in pursuing scientific careers. These changes highlight the value of bringing actual scientific practices into classroom settings as related to student views of science.</ab>

        <ab>This article is about an investigation of six middle school science teachers beliefs and instructional practice about the coherence of the science they teach as articulated by National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996). Many well intentioned reform efforts focus on improving content knowledge of teachers, but many classroom teachers regularly miss opportunities to provide conceptual connections within the science ideas building the sense of coherence in science. This investigation involved a quasi experimental study to examine the efficacy of a method for collecting data about middle school science teachers thinking about science and to determine if they teach science coherently. The teachers were surveyed, interviewed, provided concept maps about their thinking of the science they taught, and observed to investigate whether their practice reflects their beliefs. An examination of the teachers' beliefs, stated and unstated curriculum, the connections among topics and the nature of science revealed that one, the observation tool may have merit for identifying the content and connections among science topics, and two, that teachers stated beliefs consistent with the National Science Education Standards' vision for coherent science, did not match their demonstrated practice. The content taught could be characterized in three ways: coherent content and few connections, coherent content and connections, and not coherent content. This indicates for this group of middle school science teachers that knowing how they think about science and how those beliefs are reflected in their teaching is complex. This study can inform teacher education and professional development efforts about the need to move beyond just content enhancement to examine prior beliefs about the connections of concepts within science.

        <ab>[...] Jackson and Murray posit that high-leverage practices do not come naturally to educators (as cited in Ball &amp; Forzani, 2011, p. 40) and must be learned through practice, and therefore should be included in teacher education programs.  Five identified high-leverage practices for achieving ambitious math goals include: * Choosing and using mathematical tasks that entail complex mathematical work and build basic skills * Using homework equitably * Responding productively to students' âerrorsâ * Teaching and using academic language * Broadening what it means to be successful in math class through the use of specific mathematically focused praise (Ball, 2011) As we look at each of these, we can see that they are both content-specific and have relevance to the field of languages.</ab>

        <ab>An introduction to the special issue of The Journal of Negro Education regarding black male achievement is presented.  The writers outline a situation wherein less than half of black males who start high school graduate within four years and students in low-income urban schools have only a 50-percent chance of being taught by a qualified math or science teacher.  They also review the literature and consider civic initiatives to enhance the educational outcomes of black males.</ab>

The lesson involves presenting students with a six-point circle and inviting them to draw different triangles by joining points on the circle and to measure their angles.  This lesson can be extended by introducing circles with a different radius or a different number of points and by asking students to explore quadrilaterals drawn in circles rather than triangles.</ab>

        <ab>This paper focuses on how geography teachers might contribute to two national goals:  attracting more women into scientific and technical fields, and helping domestic students of both sexes acquire the spatial abilities and knowledge required to make them first in the world in science and mathematics achievement.  Study in the general sciences and in engineering often demands a high degree of spatial competence.  This paper explores the nature of the relationship between sex and spatial competence, generally emphasizing some of the scientific components of geography.  It seeks first to identify key spatial abilities needed to excel in various science, technical, and some social science and humanities disciplines.  It further seeks to answer the question of whether males possess superior spatial ability, as has been reported in a number of disciplinary literatures, or whether male dominance in spatial ability generally has been overestimated.  Finally, it suggests areas where there is potential for geography teachers to assist their students to better develop their spatial knowledge and understanding, thus helping to increase the pool of American students qualified and enthused to undertake advanced course work in the sciences, engineering, and technological fields.  Our findings indicate that male superiority in spatial ability is most obvious on geometric visualization tasks and that it is most noticeable when a key variable is response time rather than accuracy.  Emerging evidence shows better female performance on other spatial tasks, including those involving spatial-relational abilities. Recent work indicates that teacher interventions (e.g., science fairs, using real world spatial illustrations, etc.), along with an encouraging equal opportunity attitude and fair classroom practices, should help all students to develop and display their spatial abilities even if they do not plan science, engineering, or technology as a career choice.

        <ab>Part of a special section on the concept of proof in mathematics education.  Balacheff's four levels of proof can characterize the nature of students' understanding of mathematical proof.  The four levels are naive empiricism, crucial experiment, generic example, and thought experiment.  These levels serve as a framework that furnishes a more dynamic examination of the nature of mathematical proof and promotes discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of individual students' justifications.  In this way, the four levels of proof can encourage the transition of students to more advanced understandings and uses of proof in mathematics.</ab>

        <ab>Online discourse environments are increasingly popular both in distance education contexts and as adjuncts to face-to-face learning. For many participants such contexts are experienced as positive, community-supported learning opportunities, but this is not the case for everyone. Understanding more about the online and off-line factors that contribute to the online experience is important in order to support equitable online learning. This study has analysed patterns of engagement and disengagement in one particular learning context; that of pre-service, math-anxious elementary candidates enrolled in a two-year pre-service program. Program supports for the self-declared math-anxious participants (n = 20 from a total cohort of 57) included small-group math investigations and participation in an online learning environment Results show tremendous variability in levels of contribution and that the online context provided most learning support for participants who had had successful social and subject-related experiences in the program. Those with fewer successful face-to-face experiences who espoused an ability-based notion of subject matter, and who felt less able to contribute substantively, participated less online. As well, patterns of participation were established rapidly and were hard to change.</ab>

        <ab>This paper argues that designing collections of 'closed' educational resources (content and technologies) for use by specific student cohorts and collections of open educational resources for use by any 'learner' require different design approaches. Learning design for formal courses has been a research topic for over 10 years as the ever growing range of digital content and technologies has potentially offered new opportunities for constructing effective learning experiences, primarily through greater sharing and re-use of such content and technologies. While progress in adopting learning design by teaching practitioners has appeared slow so far, the advent of open educational resources (OER) has provided a substantive boost to such sharing activity and a subsequent need for employing learning design in practice. Nevertheless there appears to be a paradox in that learning design assumes a reasonably well known and well defined student audience with presumed learning needs and mediating technologies while OER are exposed to a multitude of potential learners, both formal and informal, with unknown learning needs and using diverse technologies. It can be argued that innovative designs for formal courses involve creating structured pathways through a mixture of existing and new content and activities using a mixture of media and technologies in the process. This type of 'configurational' design that blends together given items to meet a particular need, rather than designing something fully de novo is typical in many areas of work and not just teaching. Such designs work very well when there is a small set of users of the innovation or their use of the innovation is narrow. However many innovations in information, communication and computing technologies often have multiple types of users and many more layers of complexity. In these cases, rather than heavily pre-define an innovative solution just to meet certain user requirements, it is necessary to design for greater flexibility so as to allow the users to adapt their use of the innovative solution for their own requirements once it has been deployed. The use of such an 'innofusion' approach for OER is highlighted using the case study of OpenLearn (www.open.ac.uk/openlearn).</ab>

        <ab>In this article, the authors examine the responses of 24 highly restructured schools to a persisting tension in American education: balancing the competing aims of providing students with common experiences, on the one hand, and addressing differences among individual students, on the other.  Conventional schools typically respond to this dilemma by dividing students for instruction into different tracks and ability groups.  Because of tracking's role in promoting inequality, however, many restructured schools have tried to minimize such differentiated structures.  Data from the highly restructured schools show that elimination of tracking is a goal that is idealized more often than it is achieved.  Detracking appeared to face more barriers in secondary than in elementary schools, and it was resisted in math more than in other subjects.  High-quality instruction appeared both in the high tracks of some structurally differentiated schools and in a few heterogeneous classes in schools that eliminated tracking.  More in-depth analyses of two schools that allocated high-quality instruction to a wide range of students show that neither heterogeneous nor homogeneous grouping present insurmountable barriers to high-quality instruction, but neither approach ensures effective teaching, either.  Conditions that supported high-quality instruction in a heterogeneous context included small class sizes, extra resources that permit a highly individualized approach to instruction, strong intellectual leadership, and the opportunity to select teachers and students.  Conditions that supported effective instruction in the context of structural differentiation included a commitment to equity across classes, teacher and student selection of courses, and teachers' intellectual commitment to subject matter.

        <ab>On October 17, 2007, a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Technology convened to investigate the âunderrepresentationâ of women in academia in the physical sciences.  All five expert witnesses and all five members of Congress agreed that the dearth of women in university science was due to sexism.  They further unanimously concluded that the solution was a revolutionary transformation of American science itself to make it all-inclusive.  Therefore, despite the fact that the evidence of gender bias in math and science is weak at best and the evidence that women are relatively disinclined to pursue these fields at the top levels is strong, efforts to apply Title IX, the gender-equity provision of the 1972 Education Amendments Act, to science education are underway.  The possible negative effects of an academic science that is quota-driven, gender-balanced, cooperative rather than competitive, and less time-consuming have not been considered.</ab>

        <ab>The writers discuss why U.S. students are consistently outperformed in math by their international counterparts.  They assert that the reason is that the U.S. is math-phobic to such an extent that it profoundly affects the country's policies, teaching practices, and, ultimately, students' performance.</ab>

        <ab>The writer, a school librarian who teaches math for part of the school day, discusses how she integrates technology into the math classroom. Although she uses the technology available, the writer feels that she has not achieved full integration.  She has realized that full technology integration into the classroom takes a lot of time.  She also asserts that being a media specialist has made her a better math teacher because she can see a bigger picture than just the classroom. Moreover, the writer asserts that her teaching experience will make her a better media specialist because she is reminded of what teachers go through every day in the classroom.</ab>

        <ab>The Middle Grades Mathematics Renaissance, which is a component of the California Alliance for Mathematics and Science, aims to help schools to transform their mathematics programs so that all students become empowered mathematically.  The principles that guide the project are that change requires teachers to become part of a professional learning community, that beliefs and behaviors are part of a reciprocal process, that the pedagogy of professional development must be congruent with the pedagogy desired in classrooms, that professional development must address equity issues, that professional development must be grounded in classroom practice, and that all teachers are capable of change.  Although the lessons learned to date have been helpful, new and unanticipated challenges continue to emerge.  The Renaissance initiative is currently reaching 40 percent of California's middle schools.  The scale of the initiative has tremendous benefits, but the challenge of reaching the other 60 percent of middle schools, as well as all high schools and elementary schools, needs to be addressed if students' experiences are to be fundamentally changed.</ab>

        <ab>Recommendations for teaching functions and graphing in pre-calculus mathematics are presented.  Central topics in pre-calculus mathematics were traditionally taught in a manner that led to inadequate understanding and to misconceptions.  The writers suggest that functions should be introduced through the use of real statistical data and developed through the use of tasks which generate a broad range of activities.  A full understanding of functions and graphs requires students to describe and interpret graphs, not just construct them.  The writers emphasize interpretation and translation, fostering adequate conceptions of functions, and using appropriate technology as a means of overcoming student difficulties in this area.</ab>

        <ab>Part of the Claremont Reading Conference 1997 yearbook on literacy. Advice for elementary school teachers on how to weave music and books together is presented.  The advice relates to integrating music into social studies, science, math, literature, and fine arts curricula. The teacher can accompany the children with an instrument or else get them to sing along with recordings, listen to recordings, or just sing new words to old tunes.  Teachers should shelve any self-doubt about their singing ability as children respond to anyone singing and are encouraged to participate.  The singing of poems is one easy way of including music in the classroom.  The poems that work best with the even meters of the songs are those that have four lines per stanza with rhyming words at the end of the second and fourth lines.</ab>

        <ab>In many countries today schools have been subjected to a testing and accountability agenda tied to a return to 'basic skills' in reading, maths and science and a demand that all children, regardless of race and class, learn these skills. In this paper I argue that current work in sociolinguistics, cognitive science, and literacy studies, work not directly involved with assessment, suggests a more complicated view of assessment and its ties with learning and equity. This view challenges the current testing and accountability agenda, but can also redefine more broadly how we have to think about learning, assessment, and equity in schools. I develop this view around one key notion, namely opportunity to learn. In each section of the paper I discuss some area of current research relevant to learning and assessment and then state a principle about opportunity to learn. While I centre my discussion around assessing reading, in the end I make clear that my argument applies to assessment of all content areas in school (e.g. maths and science).</ab>

        <ab>Part of a symposium on Critical Links:  Learning in the Arts and Student and Academic and Social Development.  Disguised as serious research, Critical Links is really just another item in a lengthy series of publicly funded federal arts advocacy reports and public relations packets.  Published by the Arts Education Partnership in response to the charge by its own research task force to put together such a compendium, Critical Links is the federal arts bureaucracy's most recent effort to influence public policy and improve its own political standing by channeling arts education funding and research in the direction of math, reading, and social service programming.  It is easy to see that the report is an unashamed effort to depict methodologically weak studies as âstrongâ research or to turn tenuous correlations into extremely significant ones that could be accepted as causative.  Furthermore, the volume acts as a vehicle to advance the federal arts' bureaucracy's decades-old practice of using arts education to sustain political support and public funding.</ab>

        <ab>The teaching of manual drafting skills can no longer be justified in technology education.  Any design drafting program that intends to prepare students for the future must teach drawing in the context of the design process; include ideation, communication, and documentation drawing; focus on freehand techniques for ideation and communication drawing; include the use of color and texture; use computer-aided design drafting software for designing documentation drawings; and familiarize students with the concepts of three-dimensional solid modeling.</ab>

        <ab>The author comments on the need for educators to explain what effective education is to the public. Khan Academy is described as an extensive system of online video tutorials that teachers and parents may find useful in helping students understand math concepts and monitor student progress. Though deemed as a valuable tool for math educators and families, with its founder Salman Khan said to be deserving of the Harold W. McGraw, Jr. Prize, the Khan videos are not considered as something that would replace teachers anytime soon. Educators are suggested to explain to school boards, parents and local businesses what is happening in their schools and why as communities need to see what an effective pedagogy looks like from people who do it and not just from mainstream media.</ab>

        <ab>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) underpins its extensive policy work with strong databases of comparable statistics and indicators with which it compares countries. In 2000, it extended its education database with its first collection of data on the performances of 15-year-olds in reading, mathematics and science through its Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which continues on a three-yearly cycle. In developing PISA, crucial decisions were made about the target student population, sampling requirements, tests development frameworks, translation procedures and pilot testing regimes prior to full data collection. The international comparisons of student performance offer much more than rankings of countries. Analyses of students' social backgrounds and their performances on the PISA measures, for example, have shown that some countries achieve both high quality and high equity together. While the analyses can point only to possible explanations of how they have managed this, they do at least show what is possible and encourage more detailed examination of strategies for achieving such a quality/equity mix.</ab>

        <ab>An article condensed from the March issue of Schools in the Middle: Theory into Practice.  If teachers are to do justice to literature and writing in high school, these subjects should be taught in two separate courses, as is done in many college English departments. Such a division could make the implementation of Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) a reality in schools.  WAC means, in general, that writing is a vital skill that deserves liberation from the English classroom, and it is an important idea in any deliberation on changes in the language arts curriculum.  The idea behind WAC is that every subject area has a type of writing that is appropriate to the discipline, regardless of whether it is math, science, or social studies.</ab>

        <ab>This paper explores how students invoked different conceptions of ânatureâ in eight socio-scientific group discussions about human gene therapy. The paper illustrates and discusses how the students articulated nature and to what extent they elicited science factual content in the process. While the students in this study invoked nature at key places in a variety of dialectical contexts in the discussions, these invocations were often uncritical appeals and rarely involved science factual content. Even when an argument from nature was challenged, the author of that argument would often shift the sense of nature rather than elaborate upon the argumentation. It is argued that if students were properly introduced to the evaluative character of the term ânatureâ it would not just be conducive to the quality of their argumentation, but also invite them to foreground science factual content at key places in their discussion.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special issue on closing achievement gaps.  Although public schools have always been organized around standards, the implicit policy of different standards for different students has now been overturned and replaced by a policy of common standards for all students.  The standards movement began with the seemingly simple task of defining an adequate education in student content standards and then moved on to setting professional requirements for teachers and paraprofessionals and for professional in-service training.  As the federal government has become involved in standards-based reform, states have sometimes been pushed even further to include once-excluded disabled and limited-English proficient students and to set achievement targets in reading and mathematics.  Standards-based reform has brought some coherence to education at the elementary and middle school levels, but a good deal of work remains to be done, particularly in upgrading the professional workforce and concentrating on high schools.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special issue on data and chance.  Teachers may find it difficult to encourage classroom discourse and assessment when teaching with authentic data analysis problems.  When students are engaged in authentic data analysis, teachers can play an important role by pressing students to justify solutions in ways that are appropriate for the data and context in which they are working.  Moreover, teachers need to assess the quality of students' understandings on an ongoing basis in order to determine where to go next with instruction.</ab>

The practice of a student merely memorizing facts and regurgitating them and reproducing mathematical solutions that are not new does not amount to learning.  Science is basically an inquiry-based discipline.  Students who have deduced the correct answer have only just mastered that knowledge, so are more attuned to why their peers are still in the dark and hence can more intuitively guide them to enlightenment.</ab>

        <ab>An activity that can assist students in evaluating risk more thoughtfully is described.  Both psychosocial factors and ignorance of how to analyze numerical descriptions of risk affect risk perception; individuals who lack mathematical skills may overreact to relatively minor risks and disregard real ones.  The exercise uses isotretinoin (Accutane), an acne medication that can cause depression, stomach pain, blurred vision, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and severe birth defects, as an example.  Following completion of the exercise, the concepts of absolute and relative risk are formally introduced.  Students then analyze an article addressing risk and determine whether there are sufficient data to determine risk, whether the risks stated are absolute or relative, and whether the data justify the article's conclusions.</ab>

        </sug>
        <ab>Children, power and schooling: how childhood is structured in the primary schoolDympna Devine, 2003Stoke on Trent, Trentham BooksÂ£17.99, 166 pp.ISBN 1-8585-6271-6Devineâs study is built around a compelling and often entertaining account of the lives of children in Dublin primary classrooms in the 1990s. The account is framed by a combination of theoretical perspectivesâfrom earlier sociologies of the classroom, and more recent theories from the sociology of childhoodâbrought together to construct a coherent overview of the structural positioning of children as pupils. This hybrid theorizing generates a range of interesting interpretations and conclusions: about the status of children in classrooms; about the ways that structure and agency interact in the lives of individual teachers and children, and of whole groups; and about the complex contribution of social class, sex, academic ability and peer group culture to childrenâs perceptions of their role and position.The analysis derives from data collected from 133 children, aged around six to 10, and their teachers and head teachers, during a single school year. The children are observed in five classrooms in three different schools, selected for their varied social class intake, and much of the data presented consists of quotations from childrenâs interviews. The very disparate views offered by younger and older children, boys and girls, from differing socio-economic backgrounds, together present a complicated mosaic of beliefs and practices, in which the underlying structural and power issues can be hard to identify. This rich jumble of evidence however has been carefully categorized, and is presented as chapters focused on the separate themes of curriculum, pedagogy, evaluation and social relationships, so as to present an integrated overall analysis.This overall argument is a familiar one by now: that children and childhood, though socially constructed in particular ways by different societies, always constitute a minority social group, whose scholastic âworkâ is not valued as a social contribution, and whose rights are over-ridden by adult views of their best interests. Schooling, of course, is one of the key ways in which individual childrenâs wishes are subjugated to societal ends. Societyâs âinterestsâ, on the whole internalized by the children, relate to their future status as adults in employment, rather than to their present status as individuals with rights to a say in their own daily lives. In the present, they are generally voicelessâand this study is one of many attempting to allow them to be heard.All these arguments are supported by the data presented, most tellingly by the childrenâs own blunt but pragmatic reflections on the way things are in schools. Like children everywhere, these Irish children know where power is located in schools, and can identify a subtle hierarchy of authority and control, in which they themselves participate. This participation is not merely acceptance or resistance of adult power: the children themselves organize their own oppressive power structures, in which classmates who are viewed as clever or stupid, popular or pretty, socially adept or diffident, make each othersâ lives bearable or unbearable. At the same time, the relationships between teachers and their classes is not at all one of simple dominance: like the teachers depicted in earlier studies, Devineâs teachers are engaged in a constant struggle, attempting to sustain their idealistic, vocational and caring intentions in the face of daily demands and pressures, from government and other sources, as well as from children. The children, in their turn, recognize the teachersâ dilemma, and are generally supportive of the negotiated power-sharing arrangements that enable the classroom to function from day to day. Most children in the study feel teachers treat them well, and are positive about school; while a surprisingly large number of them (72%) identified a child, rather than an adult, as âhaving the most power in schoolâ (p. 26).The Irish Republic, of course, is not only a foreign country but a postcolonial one; like many postcolonial nations, it appears to retainâat the time of this studyâsome colonial educational practices that are unusual in the UK. These include the predominance of whole-class teaching; the classrooms with desks in rows; the teacherâs desk placed at the front of the classroom for full surveillance, or worse, at the back, so that surveillance is carried out undetected; and the evident lack of autonomy experienced by most children in the matter of their own learning and working habits. So UK teachers and researchers may feel this is a somewhat alien world, and the children somewhat old-fashioned in their acceptance of structural rigidity and inequality. The theoretical models, nevertheless, transcend the actual evidence and remain a pressing reminder of continuing, and universal, concerns. The recommendations for policyâfor increases in pupil representation, and improved work on citizenshipâhave to some extent already achieved New Labour orthodoxy.A minor, but depressing, query: donât publishers employ copy-editors any more? One glance at the references had me reaching for my pencil as if this were student work for correction. I spotted over 30 errors or inconsistencies in a quick read-through: authors (when names like Althusser are mis-spelt, you wonder if the author actually consulted them), punctuation (apostrophes), chronology, variant referencing forms, repetitions. The main text itself, though written in a forceful and clear style, also had its share of mis-spellings and misplaced apostrophes. I couldnât help wondering what those strict Irish teachers would have thought of it.Liz Brooker, Institute of Education, University of London, Bedford Way, London WCIH ONT, UKA new deal for children? Re-forming education and care in England, Scotland and SwedenBronwen Cohen, Peter Moss, Pat Petrie and Jennifer Wallace, 2004Bristol, Policy PressÂ£19.99, xii?+?241pp.ISBN 1-8613-4528-3With childrenâs centres expected to become an election issue in the UK, this is a very timely book because it examines early years education and care policy in three European countries. The book is a comparative research study of England, Scotland and Sweden, which all brought early childhood education and care services, schools and school age childcare under the same government department in the mid to late 1990s. It looks at the nature of the reforms, explores the relationships between childrenâs education and care as well as how they intersect with family life and employment. Although devolution has given Scotland some control over childcare and education policy, there is still some policy overlap with England and so Scotland emerges as a bridge between the situation in England and Sweden.One of the most striking differences between Sweden and England/Scotland is the way in which the child is seen in public policy. In Sweden, this period has seen what the authors describe as âa paradigm shift in how the child is understoodâ (p. 39). There is less emphasis on the âpoorâ child or the child as victim than in England/Scotland. Another difference is the concept of âpedagogyâ that is central to Swedish childcare and education practice. In England/Scotland childcare and education are seen as separate, although as one interviewer said, we âcanât educate without caring and a good carer canât care without offering some developmental potentialâ (p. 41) suggesting that caring and education need not be so polarized.Another difference between Sweden and England/Scotland is the balance of public and private provision of childcare that has developed over the past three decades. The largely public provision in Sweden is contrasted with the marketization of childcare in England and Scotland where private provision dominates. In this sense, although there were major reorganizations at national government level in all three countries, there were also continuities in policies in relation to public or private provision.Each national study examines the condition of workers within the childcare and education sectors. Women make up the majority of the labour force in all three countries. In Scotland and England there are many different levels of pay, training and qualifications. There have been some predictions that with the integration of childcare and education services differences within the workforce would breakdown. However, it is still a fragmented and poorly paid workforce. There have been attempts to introduce training, which would enable childcare workers to move into the education sector. In Sweden, a much greater degree of integration of the workforce has been achieved. The merger of trade unions, which helped to strengthen their bargaining power at municipal level, led this integration. One of the questions posed by the book is whether liberal welfare regimes (e.g., England and Scotland) with significant private provision of childcare can undertake a major revaluation and reform of the workforce.Sweden is presented as the third case study. Although the profile of Sweden is not uncritical, it still emerges as a vision of what can be done. In Sweden there was a clear move of welfare childcare functions/services into the education sector both at national government level and local level. The reforms signified the move from having achieved a provision of childcare for parents in employment to a greater focus on the child and pedagogy, which also had strong political support. The concept of lifelong learning starts with the young child. In this sense, Sweden can be seen as an example of universal coverage evolving from targeted services. In Scotland/England, child policy is âtargeted and welfarist in natureâ (p. 190) with great emphasis on joined up working and the reduction of poverty and social exclusion. Sweden has a longer history of providing integrated parental leave, childcare and employment but in Scotland and England these issues are only now being addressed.Each country case study begins with a profile of a child in that country which is a vivid way of illustrating the complexity of service delivery. Interview material provides some insights into the reality of policy implementation, especially the problems of achieving âjoined upâ government in England and Scotland. This provides valuable evidence of some of the problems facing public policy implementation that are relevant to many aspects of social policy.Local authorities are seen as playing an important role in shaping service developments. In Sweden there is a much greater degree of decentralization and so communes are able to make extensive decisions about services. In Scotland, local authorities have greater scope for service planning and development than in England. The modernization of public services, with an increasing emphasis on local control, has a potential role to play in changes in childcare and education.National political commitment is seen as central to the reforms. A Minister who is willing to champion and promote policies from the top was considered as essential to the success of any reforms.There is a major unresolved issue in all three countries about whether childcare should be treated as a facet of education and what the influence of âschoolificationâ or being in one form of institution from age one will have on childhood. The book calls for more time to think about and analyze the changes.Jane Lethbridge, Senior Research Fellow, Public Services International Research Unit, Business School, University of Greenwich, London, SE10 9LS.Strategies for inclusive practiceChristine Tilstone and Richard Rose (Eds), 2003London, RoutledgeFalmerÂ£75.00 (hbk), Â£19.99 (pbk), xiii?+?234 pp.ISBN 0-415-25485-XThis edited book is about the making and interpretation of policies relating to inclusive education in the classroom. It provides a useful overview of government policy in England relating to special educational needs and inclusive education since the beginning of the sea-change ushered in by the 1981 Education Act. While the complexities and contradictions involved in policy making and the ideological struggles which take place around different interpretations of inclusion and exclusion provide a backdrop to the contributions, the main purpose of the book is to explore current policy issues relating to classroom, school and LEA practices in different contexts. It is essentially concerned with placing âpractice at the forefrontâ and relates specifically to the âteaching and learning of pupils with special educational needsâ (p. 3), indicating a particular interpretation of inclusive education as being primarily concerned with pupils labeled as having special educational needs. The range of alternative interpretations are acknowledged in a number of chapters in the book. In the opening chapter, âIdeology, reality and pragmatics: towards an informed policy for inclusionâ, Rose evokes the different ideological strands and starting points in recent debates which he sees as divided between those âpromoting full inclusionâ who, he argues, âhave largely written from a moral or humanistic perspectiveâ and those who âperceive major obstacles in the path of developing inclusive schoolsâ (p. 13). Discussion in which ideology, the interpretation of policy and the conditions necessary for inclusive education to develop, must be joined with a critical exploration of teaching and learning and the need for change at the level of professional practice. This chapter provides a framework for subsequent contributions written by teachers, researchers and policy-makers which, while adopting broadly similar principles, engage with a range of different perspectives and issues.The book is divided into three sections. Part 1, âResponding to diversity: the development of policies and strategiesâ, is made up of seven chapters which are intended to support professionals in developing policies and strategies to enhance the learning of all pupils and, in particular, those who experience difficulties in learning. This section, headed by Roseâs chapter, has contributions in the following areas: strategies for responding to individual learning needs in an inclusive context (Marie Howely and Sue Kime); overcoming discriminatory practices with reference to pupils identified as having severe or profound and multiple learning difficulties who belong to minority ethnic groups (Ann Ferguson and Trudy Duffield); an exploration of issues relating to inclusion and gender, ethnicity and special educational needs (Liz Gershel), which draws on Corbettâs notion of connective pedagogy (2001) and argues powerfully for âa holistic educational philosophy for equity and achievementâ (p. 63); school policies for positive behaviour management which stresses the importance of creating âtime and space for talking and listening to pupilsâ (Ted Cole); collaborative multi-agency work with particular reference to pre-school education (Penny Lacey); the development of approaches to âinclusive therapyâ in a chapter which raises the issue of âinvisible forms of exclusionâ in settings in which âneeds are met superficially in mainstream schoolsâ (p. 111) and, refreshingly, stresses the importance of the role of professionals in empowering children with learning difficulties, rather than managing them (Christopher Robertson).The second section of the book, âPolicies into practice through two core subjectsâ, explores issues and possible tensions in teaching and learning in maths and English in relation to pupils who have special educational needs. Jill Porterâs clear, closely analytical and well-illustrated chapter argues that it is essential for teachers and learning support assistants to understand the wider concepts of mathematics and how learning takes place, as well as having positive attitudes and expectations. Porter observes that maths is a subject âin which pupils included into mainstream have been found to make greater gains owing to its pivotal place within the curriculumâ (p. 120).The following chapter by Richard Byers and Linda Ferguson addresses important issues on literacy in relation to children from identified as having severe and profound and multiple learning difficulties. The final section of the book covers a range of wider policy issues and contexts ranging from inclusion in early years (Rob Ashdown); the development of inclusive practices in the 16â19 sector (Caroline Broomhead), the role of the LEA in developing inclusive policies (Sue Fagg), a case study of one LEA (Jim Wolger) which is used to explore some of the tensions and possibilities presented by the development of inclusive policies, and the role of the educational psychologist in developing inclusive education (Sue Sanderson). The book ends with a useful chapter by Christine Tilstone which draws the main strands of the book together and outlines some ways forward for developing inclusive education and the role of professional development.The main strengths of this book lie in its serious engagement with the multiple interfaces between policies as they are made by government, LEA and school, and policies as they are enacted by professionals in the daily practices of management, teaching and learning. There is a clear commitment to reducing barriers to participation and an affirmation that developing inclusive practice is the responsibility of schools, teachers and policy makers at all levels. Some chapters are particularly effective in probing and illuminating areas of policy and practice which can be challenged and reconceptualized in order to reduce barriers to inclusion, many providing useful and detailed examples. The book makes a powerful statement about the right of all learners to full participation in all aspects of the curriculum and challenges by example the common assumption that there are subject areas which are âtoo difficultâ for some learners. Less appealing is the slippage into a deficit view of some pupils which occurs in a few chapters. One way of challenging problems of representation and language is to undertake a critical engagement with labeling and its effects. In addition, a fuller discussion of the need for a wider transformation in the cultures and practices of education systems and schools as an essential part of achieving inclusive education, would have further strengthened this edited collection.Strategies to promote inclusive practice follows on from Promoting inclusive practice (Tilstone et al., 1998) which was joint winner of the 1999 TES/NASEN Academic Book Award. This accessible and well-organized book makes important connections between professional practice and the wider policy context. It will undoubtedly be very useful for practitioners and others interested in developing inclusive practices, and for students on diploma and masters courses relating to special education needs and inclusive education.Felicity Armstrong, School of Educational Foundations and Policy Studies, Institute of Education, 59 Gordon Square, London WCIH ONT.</ab>

        <ab>Math activities for students in grades 5â8 and 9â12 are presented. Students in grades 5â8 use a newspaper to find the number of points scored in 13 National Football League games.  They then create a chart with the headings teams, game scores, and total points scored and answer questions relating to the chart.  This activity can be continued for a number of weeks so that patterns can be found. Students in grades 9â12 can become involved in a fantasy stock market activity that helps them to become more financially organized as they learn about the markets.</ab>

        <ab>Modern Brazil has many positive attributes, but its school system continues to disappoint.  Indeed, in OECD worldwide tests of students' abilities in reading, math, and science, Brazil scores lower than other developing countries, despite heavy government spending on education.  The federal government can only do so much, however, as improving education mainly falls to state and municipal governments, which face two main problems.  The first is teacher truancy:  teachers have the ârightâ to take five days off each year without warning or explanation, but many take more.  The second problem is that too many students repeat entire school years and drop out before graduating; just 42 percent of students currently graduate from high school.</ab>

        <ab>Moyra Bond, the creator of the well-known Bond Assessment Papers, died in February aged 95 years.  In 1958, having taught mathematics at several schools, Bond bought Avalon, a girls' preparatory school in the Wirral.  At that time, her local authority required all pupils to sit not just the standard 11-plus exam but also a 10-plus exam.  Bond began to devise her own math questions with which her pupils could practice, which she later developed into test papers and sent to educational publisher Nelson's.  The first books of questions in math, English, and verbal reasoning for pupils aged 8 to 11 were published in 1964, with the author's name given as J. M. Bond.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special report on the state of education.  Recent studies highlight how teachers, administrators, and parents view schools.  According to one report, 67 percent of high-school teachers say their state's science standards prepare students well or very well for college-level work, but less than half as many postsecondary instructors agree.  The discrepancy is even larger for math, reading, and English/writing.  Another report found that 94.6 percent of administrators agreed or strongly agreed that their students could achieve high scores on standardized tests compared to just 77.2 percent of teachers.  Meanwhile, as in previous years, citizens are much less happy with the state of the nation's schools than those in their own community.</ab>

        <ab>The writer discusses a TI-83 graphing-calculator feature that can be used in conjunction with the classic birthday paradox.  The feature is a random-integer generator that, with the correct commands, enables the calculator to create lists of random birthdays that can be used as data for students to explore.  It is then possible for students to run calculator-based simulations of the birthday paradox and explore the fact that more than 50 percent of the time, when groups of random strangers are assembled, just 23 people are needed to find a matching pair of birthdays.  The writer considers how this activity is used to demonstrate the birthday paradox.</ab>
