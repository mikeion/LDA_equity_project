        <ab>In this article, I investigate the influence of the dominant culture characterizing mathematics education--which I term the "culture of exclusion"--on efforts to teach for equity. Analyzing a year of observations in an urban high school mathematics department, I found that this culture structured everyday instruction even for teachers who expressed strong commitment to equity and who participated in ongoing equity oriented professional development. Through their classroom practice, the 4 focal teachers in this study often framed mathematics as a fixed body of knowledge to be received, and they positioned students as deficient, unintentionally excluding many students from rich learning opportunities. However, these teachers also asserted alternatives to the culture of exclusion, showing how resistance to this culture might take shape in everyday mathematics instruction.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reports on gender and participation in one inquiry-oriented undergraduate mathematics course. While there is evidence that inquiry can better support all learners, especially women, less is known about the distribution of participation in inquiry classrooms. Here, we focus on how men and women participated in both public spaces (in plenary with the whole class) and private spaces (with their group members). We found that while many women provided a large number of high-level "why" contributions in their groups, this did not necessary translate to participation in plenary discussions. We thus argue that women's competence was hidden to the whole class, which contributes to the systematic marginalization of women in mathematics.</ab>

        <ab>The statistics about community college developmental math level and completion rates can seem disheartening, especially for those who work with these students day-to-day and know their life stories. When it comes to teaching her students, the author chooses not to focus on the statistics. Instead, she pays attention to their varied career goals and the life experiences that characterize who they are. This diversity means a world of unexplored possibilities for her, their math teacher who wants to provide them with a strong quantitative background, regardless of their eventual college choice. The real hurdles, however, are how to provide them with a solid mathematics foundation while helping them learn how to conquer their unique challenges and the many years of imprinted preconceptions about what it means for them to learn math. This article looks at the author's efforts to develop and implement successful instructional experiences within an elementary algebra classroom at a community college, a common entry-point course with content similar to what is taught in high school algebra 1. While contexts and developmental stages between school levels may differ, increasing mathematical access and developing lifelong mathematics learners is a central objective for all mathematics teachers. The following two basic principles presented in this article, based on instructional experiences and a review of relevant literature, may be used to increase mathematical access effectively: (1) Design flexible lessons that are open to student input. Balance time to establish relationships with and among students; and (2) Build on misconceptions and errors, which can be a major source of learning. The author provides three "snapshots" from her teaching journal which demonstrate the application of these principles.</ab>

        <ab>Language, which plays a special role for the learning of mathematics, is investigated in this article for the specific discourse practice of explaining during whole-class discussions: On the one hand, explaining is a medium for learning since school cannot be thought of without communication. On the other hand, students at the beginning of secondary school are still in the process of language acquisition and are also still learning how to communicate mathematically. Thus, students are learning to explain in mathema-tics classrooms. This empirical study focuses on the overall question of how discourse competence, participation in classroom discourse, and mathematical learning opportunities are related. For that purpose, the approach of Interactional Discourse Analysis is introduced to mathematics education research and coordinated with the Interactional-Epistemic Perspective from mathematics education. The relevance of explaining is shown theoretically and empirically and a description is given of how limited discourse competence and limited epistemic participation proceed across situations.</ab>

        <ab>In mathematics education, researchers have proposed a wide range of improvements of teaching practice in school, but only a few of these proposals have sustainably changed mathematics education in the desired form. This article takes off with the assumption that this gap between ideals and practice can be understood and challenged through a better understanding of the social functions of mathematics education. Functionalism is a sociological paradigm, which is based on the assumption that sub-systems of society support each other. The application of this theory to mathematics education seeks to illuminate the social connectedness of classroom practice and incorporates various studies from the field of mathematics education and beyond. Its originality lies in its ability to integrate and order results from many different socio-political studies in mathematics education and to identify research desiderata in the field. On this basis, I show that in spite of official discourses on the use-value of mathematics, we lack evidence that mathematics education is functional in providing socially necessary qualifications in mathematics. Instead, possible other functions of mathematics education such as the training of economically beneficial character traits, the legitimisation of mathematics as a social tool of power, the transfer of social advantages from parents to children, the training of a bureaucratic mentality and the projection of societal wishes and fears are discussed. The results do not only provoke further debate on educational goals of mathematics education but may form a basis on which to plan educational innovation with particular attention towards social constraints underlying mathematics education.</ab>

        <ab>This study demonstrates the importance of a critical lens on disability in mathematics educational research. This ethnographic and interview study investigated how ability and disability were constructed over 1 year in a middle school mathematics classroom. Children participated in two kinds of mathematical pedagogy that positioned children differently: procedural and discussion-based. These practices shifted over time, as the teacher increasingly focused on memorization of procedures to prepare for state testing. Two Latino/a children with learning disabilities, Ana and Luis, used multiple cultural practices as resources, mixing and remixing their engagement in and identifications with mathematics. Ana, though mastering the procedural performances necessary for success in the second half of the year, authored herself as separate from mathematics, creating distance between herself and those she considered 'smarties.' Luis was identified as a creative mathematical problem-solver and was initially positioned as a 'top' mathematics student. As the pedagogy shifted towards memorization, Luis resisted the pedagogy of procedures and continued to identify as a creative thinker in mathematics. Yet, his teachers saw him as increasingly disabled and eventually placed him in a group only for those in special education. This group, which Luis named the 'unsmartest group,' was seen as least competent in mathematics by both teachers and students. The narratives of Luis and Ana highlight mathematics classrooms as relational and emotional and demonstrate different strategies of resistance to the construction of mathematical disability.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, I reflect on equity research in order to describe a perspective on the mathematics classroom as a non-neutral place where issues of power and identity play out in teaching and learning processes. This view of the mathematics classroom takes seriously issues of equity in the form of power and what becomes constituted as legitimate mathematics while attending to the out-of-school practices in which students engage. This orientation and its related issues are significant in that they provide an alternative perspective on investigating equity in mathematics classrooms that is in contrast to efforts that focus specifically on comparing standardized test scores of specific groups based solely upon racial classifications.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, we explore how a school in Aotearoa [New Zealand] infuses the iden-tity of Indigenous students into the school-based curriculum through the promotion of their language and culture in mathematics lessons. Bernstein's pedagogic device illustrates how teachers' practices were influenced by being able to think the "unthinkable." This came from the contestation that arose when competing bodies of knowledge had to be integrated both at the school level and at the classroom level. For equity to be achieved regarding students' mathematics learning, parents' and the community's aspirations for students' education need to be infused into debates about the knowledge that teachers are expected to include in their teaching. This enables the local context to make a positive contribution to students' learning. It also implies that programs for improvement should not be imposed on schools unless there are opportunities for them to be adapted to the needs of individual schools.</ab>

        <ab>This article outlines several forms of instructional practice that distinguished middlegrades mathematics classrooms that were organized around conceptually oriented activity and marked by African American students' success on state assessments. We identified these forms of practice based on a comparative analysis of teaching in (a) classrooms in which there was evidence of conceptually oriented instruction and in which African American students performed better than predicted by their previous state assessment scores and (b) classrooms in which there was evidence of conceptually oriented instruction but in which African American students did not perform better than predicted on previous state assessment scores. The resulting forms of practice can inform professional learning for preservice and in-service teachers.</ab>

        <ab>This article presents findings from an ongoing study focused on deconstructing pedagogical practices of successful mathematics teachers in classrooms with high populations of traditionally underserved students. Using grounded theory, the manuscript reports on general themes and specific practices of culturally responsive mathematics teaching (CRMT) that have been 'unearthed' from data collected over several years in three diverse mathematics classrooms. The findings indicate that, regardless of cultural setting, relationships and trust are central to CRMT, while communication patterns and various forms of knowledge mediate these relationships. Ultimately, CRMT provides student access, which is mediated by culture and identity, to complex mathematical ideas. Common concrete practices, such as warm demander pedagogy and reflection, are discussed. These results speak to the complexity of the culturally responsive mathematics classroom and provide suggestions to educators, administrators, and teacher educators who aim to become more culturally responsive.</ab>

        <ab>This literature review focuses on the definitions and roles of inclusion in the field of mathematics education to help promote the sustainable development of inclusion in the discipline. Discourse analysis was used to analyse 76 studies published between 2010 and 2016. The results show that the term inclusion is used both for an ideology and a way of teaching, and these two uses are most often treated separately and independently of each other. When inclusion is treated as an ideology, values are articulated; when treated as a way of teaching, interventions are brought to the fore. When the notion of inclusion is used as an ideology, the most extensive discourse concerns equity in mathematics education; when it is used as a way of teaching, the most extensive discourse relates to teaching interventions for mathematical engagement. Based on the literature review, if sustainable development of inclusion in mathematics education is to be promoted, scholars need to connect and interrelate the operationalisation and meanings of inclusion in both society and in mathematics classrooms, and take students' voices into consideration in research.</ab>

        <ab>This article describes how teachers in a professional development course responded to what they noticed about children's participation in elementary mathematics class-rooms and how what they noticed was connected to the teachers' positionality toward equitable mathematics pedagogy. The study connects scholarship in teacher noticing about children's mathematical thinking to scholarship in equity and mathematics teacher education. Data from teacher reflections on classroom video were analyzed to identify how teachers attended to, interpreted, and responded to what they noticed about children's participation. Findings suggest that a lens of participation supported teachers as they considered how to provide more equitable mathematics instruction. Further, the depth to which teachers noticed children's participation was connected to their positionality as equitable mathematics educators.</ab>

        <ab>This article explores the potential of critical mathematics (CM) in terms of its ability to disrupt traditional patterns of student participation in classroom discourse. It draws on tools from critical discourse analysis to examine transcripts from CM activities taught in a remedial high school setting. It points to the promise of CM in terms of its ability to alter established patterns of participation and achievement and to engage previously disengaged students. It indicates how CM instruction might open up a discursive space for traditionally marginalized students to express their ideas and to assert their subjectivity. However, it also raises issues that mathematics educators interested in critical pedagogy should consider, including ongoing issues of passive and active student resistance to CM.</ab>

        <ab>This brief essay offers an introduction to a special symposium on equity in STEM-rich making. The introduction provides context that frames current equity issues in the Maker Movement, as well as short descriptions of the four articles included in the symposium. Collectively the papers in this symposium examine how complex power dynamics shape youths' making experiences, and how carefully designed equity-oriented pedagogical and design approaches can support youth in challenging sociohistorical narratives and complex power dynamics around making. The four articles pay attention to how making, innovation, and community spaces are always under negotiation, resulting in potential in-between spaces where individuals reproduce and resist the narratives at play there.</ab>

        <ab>The article reflects on the reasons behind the continuous lower performance of African American students compared to their white counterparts, particularly in mathematics, despite the increased focus on the need for equal opportunities for all students. It suggests that low expectations play a significant role in the level of achievement of African American students in mathematics. It also examines the teaching of an effective mathematics teacher in an urban middle school and finds that high expectations are at the core of his teaching. It also gives examples to illustrate the three facets of high expectations.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, we explore a sociological approach to mathematics education and offer a theoretical lens through which we can come to understand mathematics education as part of a wider set of social practices. Many studies of children's experiences in school show that a child's academic success is a product of many factors, some of which are beyond the control and, sometimes, the knowledge of the classroom teacher. We draw on the sociological ideas of Pierre Bourdieu to frame our analysis of the environment in which the pupils learn and the ways in which the practices help to create parallel worlds which are structured quite differently inside and outside the classroom. Specifically, we use Bourdieu's notions of habitus, field and capital. Using two cases, we highlight the subtle and coercive ways in which the practices of the field of mathematics education allow greater or lesser access to the hegemonic knowledge known as school mathematics depending on the cultural backgrounds and dispositions of the learners. We examine the children's mathematical learning trajectories and reflect on how what they achieve in the future will, in all likelihood, be shaped by their social background and how compatible this is with the current educational climate.</ab>

        <ab>Teachers need more clarity about effective teaching practices as they strive to help their low-achieving students understand mathematics. Our study describes the instructional practices used by two teachers who, by value-added metrics, would be considered "highly effective teachers" in classrooms with a majority of students who were English learners. We used quantitative data to select two fifth-grade classrooms where students, on average, made large gains on a mathematics achievement test, and then examined teaching practices and contextual factors present in each classroom. Participants included two teachers from a mid-Atlantic district and their students who were 67% English learners and 68% economically disadvantaged. We found that the use of multiple representations of mathematics concepts, attention to vocabulary building, individual and group checks for understanding and error analysis were prevalent practices in both high gains classrooms. Also, class sizes ranged from 12-19 students. Discussion focuses on whether observed practices are aligned with recommended teaching practices for English learner students.</ab>

        <ab>This paper is centered on creating equitable opportunities for learners in mathematics education. Through observations of teacher practice, the paper seeks to theorize how teachers enact their dispositions toward mathematics instruction. These observed propensities, in relation to teachers' aims for students to 'take up their space' in and beyond the mathematics classroom, then inform a model of equitable mathematics instruction. Teachers' dispositions are considered in relation to Mason's discipline of noticing and Bourdieu's notion of the symbolic violence of dominant discourses.</ab>

        <ab>This study examined whether or not embodied-agent-based learning would help middle-grade females have more positive mathematics learning experiences. The study used an explanatory mixed methods research design. First, a classroom-based experiment was conducted with one hundred twenty 9th graders learning introductory algebra (53% male and 47% female; 51% Caucasian and 49% Latino). The results revealed that learner gender was a significant factor in the learners' evaluations of their agent (η² = .07), the learners' task-specific attitudes (η² = .05), and their task-specific self-efficacy (η² = .06). In-depth interviews were then conducted with 22 students selected from the experiment participants. The interviews revealed that Latina and Caucasian females built a different type of relationship with their agent and reported more positive learning experiences as compared with Caucasian males. The females' favorable view of the agent-based learning was largely influenced by their everyday classroom experiences, implying that students' learning experience in real and virtual spaces was interconnected.</ab>

        <ab>This study used Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Kindergarten Cohort data to examine influences of the home and classroom learning environments on kindergarten mathematics achievement of Black, Latino, and White children. Regardless of race/ethnicity, children who started kindergarten proficient in mathematics earned spring scores about 7–8 points higher. There was significant variability in the home and classroom learning environments of Black, Latino, and White children and associations with these children's mathematics scores. Nevertheless, reading at home was a significant predictor for spring mathematics scores for all groups. If children started kindergarten proficient in mathematics, the Latino-White mathematics gap, after controlling for home and classroom factors and other covariates, was no longer significant. However, the Black–White mathematics gap remained significant. If children did not start kindergarten proficient in mathematics, both the Latino–White and Black–White mathematics gaps remained significant.</ab>

        <ab>Equity in mathematics classroom discourse is a pressing concern, but analyzing issues of equity using observational tools remains a challenge. In this article, we propose equity analytics as a quantitative approach to analyzing aspects of equity and inequity in classrooms. We introduce a classroom observation tool that focuses on relatively low-inference dimensions of classroom discourse, which are cross-tabulated with demographic markers (e.g.. gender, race) to identify' patterns of more and less equitable participation within and across lessons. We argue that equity analytics can support researchers and practitioners in identifying subtle patterns of inequity in classroom discourse. As we show, even in classrooms with highly experienced, equity - minded teachers, subtle inequities can emerge that arc detectable through this quantitative methodology. To conclude, we discuss how equity analytics can complement qualitative approaches in the study of equity and inequity in classrooms.</ab>

        <ab>Proponents of critical mathematics (CM) argue that it has the potential to be more equitable and socially empowering than other approaches to mathematics education. In this article, the author presents results from a practitioner research study of his own teaching of CM to low-income students of color in a U.S. context. The results pertain to the evolution of his reflections about the potentially enhancing relationship between the critical and the mathematical components of CM and the nature of student empowerment as he designed and taught with CM materials. The results point to curricular and instructional factors that present serious barriers to effective implementation of CM at the secondary level.</ab>

        <ab>The article presents a summary of conceptions of equity principle of secondary mathematics teachers. It highlights a first step that teachers can do in applying equity in their mathematics classrooms. A yearlong professional development for secondary mathematics teachers was offered by the University of Wisconsin-Madison as part of their Diversity in Mathematics Education Center for Learning and Teaching. Twenty-six teachers underwent a two-and-a-half hour once-a-month seminar on readings related to equity in mathematics education. Topics discussed in the seminar include conceptions of equity, the effects of pedagogy on student classroom participation, teacher expectations, support for English language learners in mathematics, and the teaching of mathematics for social justice.</ab>

        <ab>The implementation of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices &amp; Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010) has the potential to move forward key features of standards-based reforms in mathematics that have been promoted in the United States for more than 2 decades (e.g., National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1989, 2000; National Science Foundation, 1996). We believe that this is an especially opportune time to purposely focus on improving the mathematics education of students who have historically been denied access to a high-quality and rigorous mathematics education in the United States, specifically low-income students and students of color (e.g., Kitchen, DePree, Celedón-Pattichis, &amp; Brinkerhoff, 2007; Leonard &amp; Martin, 2013). We discuss a challenge to realizing standards-based reforms in mathematics in the United States: computer-based interventions in mathematics classrooms.</ab>

        <ab>This paper draws on data from a first grade multilingual mathematics classroom in Sweden. I explore how students' agency is pronounced in the classroom that actually can be a site where mathematics reform-oriented pedagogy thrives and how the emphasis on language support in such classrooms can support reform-oriented pedagogy. I argue that the emphasis on reform-oriented pedagogy can support the learning of mathematics and a second language, simultaneously. By analysing discursive practices, I show how this supportive relationship operates alongside the on-going processes of normalisation whereby students' mother tongues continue to be erased or ignored.</ab>

        <ab>We examined whether African American students differentially responded to dimensions of the observed classroom-learning environment compared with non–African American students. Further, we examined whether these dimensions of the classroom mediated treatment effects of a preschool mathematics intervention targeted at students from low-income families. Three observed dimensions of the classroom (teacher expectations and developmental appropriateness; teacher confidence and enthusiasm; and support for mathematical discourse) were evaluated in a sample of 1,238 preschool students in 101 classrooms. Using multigroup multilevel mediation where African American students were compared with non–African American students, we found that teachers in the intervention condition had higher ratings on the observed dimensions of the classroom compared with teachers in the control condition. Further, ratings on teacher expectations and developmental appropriateness had larger associations with the achievement of African American students than for non–African Americans. Findings suggest that students within the same classroom may react differently to that learning environment and that classroom learning environments could be structured in ways that are beneficial for students who need the most support.

        <ab>Educational Impact And Implications Statement—Data from this study come from a randomized control trial of a preschool mathematics intervention. We used multigroup multilevel structural equation modeling to test whether certain instructional practices explained why African American students had differential gains in mathematics achievement as compared with non-African American students. This study suggests that, on average, African American students benefit differently from certain instructional practices (e.g., teacher expectations and developmental appropriateness) more than non-African American students. Implications suggest that content-specific interventions could be designed to include changing teachers’ beliefs about students’ abilities.

        <ab>This article shows how equity research in mathematics education can be decentered by reporting the "voices" of mathematically successful African American male students as they recount their experiences with school mathematics, illustrating, in essence, how they negotiated the White male math myth. Using poststructural theory, the concepts discourse, person!identity, and power/agency are redefined or rein-scribed. The article also shows that using a poststructural reinscription of these concepts, a more complex analysis of the multiplicitous and fragmented robust math-ematics identities of African American male students is possible--an analysis that refutes simple explanations of effort. The article concludes, not with "answers," but with questions to facilitate dialogue among those who are interested in the mathe-matics achievement and persistence of African American male students--and equity and justice in the mathematics classroom for all students.</ab>

        <ab>Student autonomy has been an important object of study for mathematics educators for many years. Over time, framings of autonomy have moved from a focus on the individual to considerations of how an individual's autonomy is entangled in classroom-level interactions. What has been less closely studied is how classroom interactions provide uneven access to autonomy for individuals. This study uses a communicational perspective to clarify Piaget's intellectual autonomy and examine students' mathematical interactions. The findings describe barriers and supports to autonomous activity for three students. Students were prevented from engaging in autonomous activity when they were seen as less capable than others, when they felt the need to manage the activities of their peers, or when they focused on being seen as knowledgeable. In contrast, students acted with autonomy when they took up the teacher's request for explanations, noticed a contrast between their answer and the right answer, and worked on making connections across different representations.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, I propose ritual as an analytic lens for understanding the persistence of practices in contemporary mathematics classrooms. By foregrounding the cultural nature of the teaching and learning of mathematics in schools, ritual analysis can provide insight about the causes and effects of practices that persist through rounds of 'reform.' I begin by considering the legacy of the notion of culture in mathematics education research. I then provide examples of ritual analysis in education research and in mathematics education research. I draw on the scholarship of Quantz () as I articulate a working definition of ritual for use in mathematics education research, considering how this definition may help raise and answer distinct questions apart from more familiar constructs. I list some well-known problems and dilemmas in mathematics education that may be promising domains for a ritual analysis, and I conclude by positioning ritual alongside other constructs and methods that are in use in mathematics education research today.</ab>

        <ab>This paper investigates the construction of systems of competence in two middle school mathematics classrooms. Drawing on analyses of discourse from videotaped classroom sessions, this paper documents the ways that agency and accountability were distributed in the classrooms through interactions between the teachers and students as they worked on mathematical content. In doing so, we problematize the assumption that competencies are simply attributes of individuals that can be externally defined. Instead, we propose a concept of individual competence as an attribute of a person's participation in an activity system such as a classroom. In this perspective, what counts as “competent” gets constructed in particular classrooms, and can therefore look very different from setting to setting. The implications of the ways that competence can be defined are discussed in terms of future research and equitable learning outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines patterns in middle-grade boys' and girls' written problem solving strategies for a mathematical task involving proportional reasoning. The students participating in this study attend a coeducational charter middle school with single-sex classrooms. One hundred nineteen sixth-grade students' responses are analyzed by gender according to the solution strategy they used to arrive at their final response to the task. The categories of solution strategies include non-response, purely additive, purely procedural, transition, novice, and mature. The proportions of girls and boys classified as mature in their strategies were essentially equal. However, more than half of girls' responses were considered purely procedural or purely additive-a proportion double that of boys thus classified.</ab>

        <ab>The introduction of the No Child Left Behind has brought renewed national attention to the persistence of achievement gaps in education and, in particularly, has challenged the mathematics education community to revisit its long stated commitment to removing achievement disparities in school mathematics. Longstanding equity messages in mathematics reform as encapsulated in the hallmark slogan, mathematics for all, have been articulated and widely circulated in reform documents over the last 20 years, but not well incorporated into many of the mathematics classrooms comprised of minority students, multi-language speakers, and students with disabilities. Employing an engineering mindset to frame the article, the purpose of this article is to illuminate some of the problematic features of equity articulation over the last 20 years, examine perspectives from two recent national meetings in Maryland and Washington, DC, and offer perspectives towards the design of a reconceptualized, more robust equity message. Seven constraints have been extracted from these perspectives. The constraints range from utilizing an outcome-focused definition of equity and an articulation of condition-based inequities, to incorporating a critical base of research and pedagogy. These constraints are discussed and future directions and applications for design are posed.</ab>

        <ab>Dramatic changes are occurring in the teaching and learning of mathematics in the nation's classrooms. It is no longer sufficient to be proficient in basic skills; students are now expected to develop deep conceptual understanding of a broad range of mathematical content areas. While there has been an increased focus on the need for equal opportunities for all students, African American students continue to score below their white counterparts, particularly in these critical areas. This paper suggests that low expectations play a significant role in the level of achievement of African American students in mathematics. It then examines the teaching of an effective mathematics teacher in an urban middle school and finds that high expectations are at the core of his teaching. Examples are given to illustrate three facets of his high expectations. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>The data reported in this article come from a large project whose goal was to explore how Latin American students in Catalonia, Spain use their two languages-Spanish and Catalan-to support their learning of mathematics in small groups with other students who are Spanish- or Catalan-dominant. For 5 years, lessons from bilingual mathematics classrooms in three public secondary schools were video-recorded and transcribed. In the presentation of findings, I discuss three language practices that emerged from the analyses of several classroom instances as follows: (1) caution with mathematical vocabulary, (2) invention of terms, and (3) word-for-word translation. One example is chosen to represent each practice and some of its situated effects. The first two examples support the view that the experience of language difficulties, either real or presumed, contributes to generating opportunities that may be beneficial to mathematics learning. The third example, where the focus on the mathematics is hindered, points to a contrasting finding. Unlike other studies in the field, which have reported the difficulties and obstacles that arise in learning and teaching due to bilingualism in the classroom, I propose a change of focus through the conceptualization of language as a potential for thinking and doing, and particularly for learning and teaching mathematics.</ab>

        <ab>The implementation of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices &amp; Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010) has the potential to move forward key features of standards-based reforms in mathematics that have been promoted in the United States for more than 2 decades (e.g., National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1989,2000; National Science Foundation, 1996). We believe that this is an especially opportune time to purposely focus on improving the mathematics education of students who have historically been denied access to a high-quality and rigorous mathematics education in the United States, specifically low-income students and students of color (e.g., Kitchen, DePree, Celedón-Pattichis, &amp; Brinkerhoff, 2007; Leonard &amp; Martin, 2013). We discuss a challenge to realizing standards-based reforms in mathematics in the United States: computer-based interventions in mathematics classrooms.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, mathematics classrooms are conceptualized as heterogeneous spaces in which multiple figured worlds come into contact. The study explores how a group of high school students drew upon several figured worlds as they navigated mathe-matical discussions. Results highlight 3 major points. First, the students drew on 2 primary figured worlds: a mathematics learning figured world and a figured world of friendship and romance. Both of these figured worlds were racialized and gendered, and were actively constructed and contested by the students. Second, these figured worlds offered resources for 1 African American student, Dawn, to position herself powerfully within classroom hierarchies. Third, these acts of positioning allowed Dawn to engage in mathematical practices such as conjecturing, clarifying ideas, and providing evidence.</ab>

        <ab>To what extent can teacher-student dyadic interactions modify the hierarchy of student performances within a single class? To answer this insufficiently researched question, the authors conducted two parallel studies involving 33 Grade 5 classes in France (759 students) and 15 Grade 5 classes in Luxembourg (243 students). Interactions were observed during whole-class lessons. Posttest scores were analyzed using multilevel models controlling for five level-1 variables and two level-2 variables. The authors did not find any effect of dyadic interactions on relative student performance in mathematics or in language (French or German), in France or in Luxembourg. This result is interpreted in terms of both the public character of dyadic interactions in whole-class settings and the class management functions of these interactions.</ab>

        <ab>This article describes the ways in which the mathematics department of an urban, ethnically diverse school brought about high and equitable mathematics achievement. The teachers employed heterogeneous grouping and complex instruction, an approach designed to counter status differences in classrooms. As part of this approach teachers encouraged multidimensional classrooms, valued the perspectives of different students, and encouraged students to be responsible for each other. The work of students and teachers at Railside School was equitable partly because students achieved more equitable outcomes on tests, but also because students learned to act in more equitable ways in their classrooms. Students learned to appreciate the contributions of students from different cultural groups, genders, and attainment levels, a behavior termed relational equity. This article describes the teaching practices that enabled the department to bring about such important achievements.</ab>

Findings detail how this teacher views the relationship between mathematics education and social justice and how her conception of teaching for social justice is enacted in her mathematics classes. Interview data and excerpts of classroom practice are used to describe how the teacher negotiates 2 dilemmas in her teaching: the challenge of fostering students' independence/interdependence and the problem of dominant mathematics as a necessity/obstacle to social justice.</ab>

        <ab>Teacher educators' processes of establishing 'mathematics for teaching' in teacher education programs have been recognized as an important area for further research. In this study, we examine how two teacher educators establish and make explicit features of mathematics for teaching within classroom interactions. The study shows how the establishment of mathematics for teaching is dependent on the use of keywords from the mathematics education domain, the introduction of variation, and the use of generic communicative strategies. As such, the study could be seen as a contribution to ongoing research on how mathematics teacher educators interactively deal with mathematics for teaching.</ab>

        <ab>We report on the development of a language of description that facilitates an integrated analysis of classroom video data in terms of the quality of the teaching-learning process and the students' access to valued forms of mathematical knowledge. Our research setting is the introduction of software for teachers for improving the mathematical learning in underprivileged classrooms. As theoretical antecedents we draw on the Théorie Anthropologique du Didactique (Chevallard) and the Theory of Pedagogic Codes (Bernstein). We systematically integrate these theories locally. As a result on a meta-theoretical level, a new methodology, consisting of a system of categories, is the product of the local integration of the two theories.</ab>

        <ab>The authors, in a nonexperimental randomized study, used national data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) to examine present instructional practices for Grade 5 mathematics classrooms and its impact on achievement for White non-Hispanic non–English language learners (ELLs), Hispanic non-ELLs, and Hispanic English language learners. The following research questions were addressed: (a) Were there significant differences in mathematics instructional practices among White non-Hispanic non-ELLs, Hispanic non-ELLs, and Hispanic-ELLs? (b) What were the effects of the mathematical instructional practices on fifth-grade mathematics achievement for these groups? Findings reveal that students’ mathematics achievement in previous grades directly impacted students’ achievement in future grades. Findings also demonstrated limited variance in the instructional practices used by teachers.</ab>

        <ab>This article presents our plans and initial work to explore how mathematics teacher education programs can prepare teachers for diverse middle grades classrooms. It describes the start-up of a five-year National Science Foundation project to design, develop, and test technology-enriched teacher preparation strategies to address equity in algebra learning. The participants in this pilot group demonstrated a need to develop their mathematical problem-solving skills, but they also exhibited strong beliefs about their own potential to be successful in the mathematics classroom. Preliminary results appear to indicate that Second Life (software) simulations can provide rich settings for teacher development on specific mathematics teaching skills and challenge them to apply their ideas about diversity.

        <ab>In considering 'good teaching' in mathematics, scholars usually refer to teacher knowledge and instructional practices that promote understanding. However, researchers have found that these two elements of instruction are often not as prevalent in urban contexts, a space where high percentages of students of color and the poor are educated. Additionally, recent work calls for understanding other classroom mechanisms that impact the mathematics learning of students of color. Using video, field notes, and an interview, this research examines a case study of one urban classroom of Latino and African American students. Their teacher engages them in substantive mathematics and reform-minded pedagogical strategies, but a number of relational interactions raise issues of how these micro-interactions can mediate access to mathematics. The study found four dimensions in which relational interactions mediated access to mathematics: addressing behavior, framing mathematics ability, acknowledging student contributions, and attending to culture and language. The paper ends with raising questions for future research and calling for a broader framing of instruction that incorporates relational dimensions of the classroom.</ab>

        <ab>Drawing on ecological psychology, this paper considers how student engagement is an accomplishment of the classroom system. Specifically, this paper presents an analysis of two teachers and their students who were using a project-based unit in their mathematics classes. The two teachers used identical curricular materials, but had dramatically different personal histories of teaching and different instructional practices. Our goal is to investigate the role of the teacher in supporting student engagement by considering the kinds of opportunities to learn that were presented by the teacher, and the relationship between those opportunities to learn and the ways their students engaged. Pragmatically, this paper contributes to our understanding of how teachers' framing of activity significantly impacts the ways that students are likely to engage tasks. Theoretically, this paper highlights the interactional nature of learning, with the goal of clarifying why learning is not simply an individual accomplishment.</ab>

        <ab>Background/Context: Recent research in mathematics education has employed sociocultural and historical lenses to better understand how students experience school mathematics and come to see themselves as capable mathematics learners. This work has identified mathematics classrooms as places where power struggles related to students' identities occur, struggles that often involve students' affiliations with racial, ethnic, and gender categories and the mathematics teacher as a critical agent in students" mathematics identity development. Frameworks for identifying resources that mathematics teachers draw on to teach are evolving, and emerging dimensions of teachers' knowledge, namely knowledge of students' lived experiences and histories, as well as teachers' experiences and identities, are increasingly being considered alongside more traditional dimensions of the knowledge teachers draw on in their practice. Purpose" The purpose of this article is to explore the perspectives and practices of two African American mathematics teachers, Madison Morgan and Floyd Lee, as they support their African American students' mathematics identity formation and development. Participants: At the time of the study, Morgan and Lee were high school mathematics teachers in a large urban school district. Both participants were selected for this analysis because of considerable differences in their life histories, pedagogical approaches, and perspectives. Research Design: Each teacher was observed approximately 25 times and interviewed 9-10 times. The primary data for this analysis consist of a subset of observations and interviews for the purposes of conducting a qualitative cross-case analysis that examines themes, similarities, and differences in Morgan's and Lee's approaches to supporting their students' mathematics identity development. Findings: Morgan's and Lee's experiences, perspectives, and practices characterize two very different perspectives of what constitutes a positive mathematics identity, while both maintain connections to race and racial identities. In both cases, there exists a subtle paradox in the underlying motivations that the teachers communicated in their interviews related to socializing their African American students and the practices they actually employ in their classrooms. Furthermore, both teachers made use of their capacity to serve as models and motivators for students' current and future success in mathematics. Conclusions/Recommendations: If equitable high-quality mathematics instruction is a sincere goal of the mathematics education community, we strongly recommend that researchers further explore the ways that teacher identity, including those dimensions associated with race, class, and gender, serves as an instructional and motivational resource as teachers work to create productive and meaningful learning environments for their students.</ab>

        <ab>Although students from diverse backgrounds may have access to equal educational opportunity by occupying the same classroom space, they do not necessarily enjoy equal and fair access to the same quality of experience within that classroom. The inequalities and inequities are partially a result of privilege, an advantage afforded to individuals because of their similarity to the norms operating in the classroom. In this article, the ways in which the white male students in a diverse, urban fourth grade classroom exercise privilege are identified and the white teacher's approach to mediating white male privilege, equality, and equity is examined. The teacher's approach is evaluated in terms of fairness via the white male students' perceptions of the classroom environment, viewed in relation to power and caring and is discussed with respect to implications for teacher preparation.</ab>

The SBI approach encourages students to go beyond surface features of word problems to understand the underlying mathematical structure of ratio and proportions.  SBI also introduces students to various strategies that can be used in answering ratio and proportion problems.</ab>

It implemented ethnomathematics and multicultural mathematics activities for the purpose of enhancing students' interest in mathematics and improve their achievement on the subject. It also want to prove the fact that all students can benefit from learning about culture and mathematics. Pre-assessments and post-assessments are implemented to measure the students' achievements.</ab>

        <ab>In the present study we explored how culture affects the learning experiences of students in a mathematics classroom. The first author, an African American male, taught a class composed solely of two Asian and 15 White students. During this two-week statistics course, students were asked to engage in a "per-formative" assessment that was intentionally linked to the teacher's culture. Findings presented in this study are based on feedback from a student survey addressing the question: How did hip-hop communicate or supplement the students' learning of statistics? The results aid in explicating the alignment between culture and mathematics by altering the learning norms and pedagogical strategies that often undergird traditional teaching.</ab>

        <ab>Part of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' 1997 yearbook on multicultural and gender equity in the math classroom.  The writers propose a scheme that overcomes the gender-equity challenges inherent in using discussion as a focus of instruction in the math classroom. The scheme is a continuum that parallels the pragmatic and idealistic visions of a gender-equitable classroom.  At one end of the continuum, teachers make decisions to address gender inequities by changing the math classroom for girls, whereas, at the other end, teachers make decisions to change girls by helping them acquire skills or beliefs that will permit them to communicate and compete in society as it is.</ab>

        <ab>A gulf exists between prior work testing metacognitive instructional interventions and teacher practices that may support metacognition in the classroom. To help bridge this gulf, we designed an observational protocol to capture whether and how teachers provide metacognitive support in their talk and examined whether these supports were related to student learning. We examined four features of metacognitive support, including the type of metacognitive knowledge supported (personal, strategy, or conditional), the type of metacognitive skill supported (planning, monitoring, or evaluating) the type of instructional manner in which the support was delivered (directives, prompting, or modeling), and the type of framing (problem specific, problem general, or domain general), during three types of instructional activities (individual, group, or whole-class instruction). We compared teacher talk from 20 middle school mathematics classrooms with high growth in conceptual mathematics scores with teacher talk from 20 classrooms with low growth. For each of these classrooms, we examined the amount of teacher talk that supported metacognition during one regular class period. Observations revealed that the high-conceptual growth classrooms had more metacognitive supports for personal knowledge, monitoring, evaluating, directive manners, and domain-general frames than the low-conceptual growth classrooms. We discuss the implications of those observations for bridging research on metacognition to teacher practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>
        <ab>Educational Impact and Implications Statement—The results of this study show that teachers vary in how they support metacognition through their talk. Teachers in classrooms with high-growth scores on a conceptual learning assessment used more metacognitive talk than teachers in classrooms with low-growth scores. To evaluate teachers’ metacognitive talk, we introduced the Metacognitive Support Framework, which allowed us to identify which aspects of metacognition were supported. This framework provides a coding protocol that can be used in future studies and is a concrete example of the different ways metacognition can be supported through talk.

        <ab>In this article, I use a Foucauldian poststructural analysis to examine productions of progress within key discursive spaces of mathematics education. These sites of production are educational policy, mathematics education research and case studies of primary school student-teachers in England. From my analysis, I show how progress governs what is possible in the classroom, as they become constructed around a measurable, linear temporality assumed in educational policy. This encourages comparison to and pursuit of the 'normal' mathematical child, which in educational policy is produced as a functional automaton, whilst for much of mathematics education research is produced as the cognitive 'natural' child. These over sanitised constructions result in confusion for student-teachers who struggle to take these impossible discourses on board.</ab>

        <ab>Achievement goals are the reasons for pursuing competence-related tasks. Much prior work has shown that they can affect student motivation, learning, and performance outcomes. They are typically measured in classroom settings vis-à-vis self-report surveys about students’ goals or the perceived goal structure of the class. Less work has measured how achievement goals naturally emerge in class instruction. We address this gap by examining teacher talk for evidence of different achievement goals and their relation to conceptual math learning. Classrooms with high- and low-growth on a conceptual mathematics assessment were compared for instances of mastery- or performance-focused talk in relation to the framing of the instructional task, student recognition, and student evaluation. Results showed that teachers from high-growth classrooms used more mastery-focused talk for both the framing of the task and student evaluation than teachers from low-growth classrooms. Teachers from low-growth classrooms used more performance-focused talk for the framing of the task than teachers from high-growth classrooms. There were no differences between high- and low-growth classrooms for either mastery or performance student recognition or performance-focused student evaluation. These results help to bridge the gap between teacher practice and achievement goal theory and have implications for understanding how goals manifest in the classroom as well as possible interventions that support productive classroom goals and student learning.

        <ab>This article suggests that a critical perspective of the notion of social representations can offer useful insights into understanding practices of teaching and learning in mathematics classrooms with immigrant students. Drawing on literature using social representations, previous empirical studies are revisited to examine three specific questions: what are the dominant social representations that permeate the mathematics classroom with immigrant students? What impact do these social representations have on classroom practices? What are the spaces for changing these practices through becoming reflective and critically aware of these representations? These questions are addressed mostly in relation to teachers’ representations, though the article also draws on data from research with students and parents to illustrate the diversity of representations and to argue for a critical and reflective perspective.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special issue on mathematics education in the context of reform.  A review of policy documents and research to explore equity in mathematics education is presented.  The review focuses on past standards documents and their treatment of equity issues, on equity-based critiques of the standards, and on research outlining strategies for accomplishing equity in mathematics education.  The review shows that three aspects of education that affect underrepresented students' success in mathematics are structural aspects of school districts, beliefs about diverse students and mathematics learning, and classroom processes.  The review also shows that a combination of high-quality curriculum materials, pedagogical strategies, assessment, and professional development based on the standards documents is necessary but not sufficient for achieving equity.  Steps for accomplishing equitable mathematics education are presented.</ab>

        <ab>The authors examined the effectiveness of strategy instruction taught by general educators in mixedability classrooms. Specifically, the authors compared the mathematical word problem-solving performance and computational skills of students who received schema-based instruction (SBI) with students who received general strategy instruction (GSI). Participants were 60 3rd-grade student participants randomly assigned to treatment conditions. Teachers pretested and posttested participants with mathematical problem-solving and computation tests, repeatedly measuring their progress on word problem solving across the 18-week intervention. Both SBI and GSI conditions improved word problem-solving and computation skills. Further, results show a significant difference between groups on the word problem-solving progress measure at Time 1, favoring the SBI group. However, this differential effect did not persist over time. The authors discuss implications for future research and practice.</ab>

        <ab>With our conceptualization of Harré and van Langenhove’s () positioning theory, we draw attention to immanent experience and read transcendent discursive practices through the moment of interaction. We use a series of spatial images as metaphors to analyze the way positioning is conceptualized in current mathematics education literature and the way it may be alternatively conceptualized. This leads us to claim that changing the way mathematics is talked about and changing the stories (or myths) told about mathematics is necessary for efforts to change the way mathematics is done and the way it is taught.</ab>

        <ab>Part of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' 1997 yearbook on multicultural and gender equity in the math classroom.  The writer examines the critical changes needed in curriculum, pedagogy, policies, and beliefs to promote equity in math education for all students in schools throughout the country.  The changes would result in an equitable learning environment that affirms the richness of cultural diversity and provides all students with an opportunity to engage in an interactive learning process.</ab>

        <ab>This paper aims to critique and develop neo-Vygotskian work in mathematics education from (i) within the Vygotskian and activity theoretic tradition, and where necessary from (ii) a Bourdieusian perspective. First, I critique Roth and Radford's () version of Cultural-historical Activity Theory, suggesting that a classroom episode presented as developmental might be seen as a process of alienation. I trace this to the institutional structure of schooling, in which curriculum and pedagogy are alienated from the learner's everyday sense. Next, I examine and critique the Vygotskian 'Funds of Knowledge' approach to critical mathematics education, which seeks to overcome alienation by subjecting the curriculum to the needs of the poor communities the school serves. Here, the critical point on alienation in the Vygotskian approach is better argued in Bourdieu's perspective on educational institutions as reproductive of class domination. Finally, the paper discusses the extent to which these critiques pertain to Vygotskian activity theory in general or only to these versions in particular and draws implications for the development of a critical mathematics education perspective in a synthesis of perspectives from Vygotsky and Bourdieu.</ab>

        <ab>This mixed-methods study couples large-scale analyses of student course-taking with case study data to explore what blocks the gate to enrollment in and successful completion of secondary math courses for students ever classified as English learners (ever ELs). Initial quantitative findings indicate that half of all students across six California districts, including ever ELs, repeated a math course between 8th and 10th grades, with limited evidence of additional learning during students’ second time in the course. Ever EL case study findings indicate that interactions between institutional (course placement policies), classroom (ways of knowing), and individual (student motivation) factors shaped students’ math course-taking trajectories, suggesting that opportunity to learn is necessary but not sufficient for educational success.</ab>

        <ab>Finnish students' success on all three content domains of each of the four cycles of the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has created much international interest. It has also prompted Finnish academics to offer systemic explanations typically linked to the structural qualities of Finnish schooling and teacher education. Less well-known has been the modest mathematics performance of Finnish grade 8 students on the two Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in which Finland has participated, which, when compared with its PISA successes, has created something of an enigma. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on this enigma through analyses of Finnish mathematics classroom practice that draw on two extant data sets-interviews with Finnish teacher educators and video-recordings of sequences of lessons taught on standard topics. Due to the international interest in Finnish PISA success, the analyses focus primarily on the resonance between classroom practice and the mathematical literacy component of the PISA assessment framework. The analyses indicate that Finnish mathematics didactics are more likely to explain the modest TIMSS achievements than PISA successes and allude to several factors thought to be unique to the Finns, which, unrelated to mathematics teaching practices, may be contributory to the repeated Finnish PISA successes. Some implications for policy-borrowing are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Teachers of elementary mathematics face multiple, convergent demands. These demands include supporting the growing population of English language learners (ELLs) and facilitating mathematical discussions across relevant curricular contexts. The authors used a comparative case study to examine how two teachers attempt to facilitate discussions while enacting a Calendar Math curriculum, in Grade 4 classrooms with high concentrations (&gt;50%) of ELLs. The authors found that these teachers' use of Calendar Math did not provide a supportive context for conceptually based discussions. However, teachers did support ELLs in mathematical discussions by including display questions, elaborating student responses, modeling the use of mathematical vocabulary use, and use of self-talk. Teachers differed with regard to how often they elaborated responses, used vocabulary, the amount of teacher speech and the length of lessons. We discuss what these practices may mean for ELLs.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this paper is initially to present findings which identify components of the practices of teachers acting as assessors of students' mathematics in the normal course of classroom work. At an informal level such practice is found to be complex and intimately related to every aspect of teaching and learning. It is found that even teachers who have undergone some assessment training may underestimate the role of interpretation of evidence, and questions about equity in the uses of teachers' judgements are raised in relation to awareness and practice. It is suggested that more care needs to be taken over the formation and use of `professional judgements' within systems of assessment.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper we present the way in which language issues have become a relevant factor in research which aims to study the socio-cultural aspects of mathematics education in classrooms with a high percentage of immigrant students. Our research on language issues focuses on two aspects, namely the language as a social tool within the mathematics classroom and the language as a vehicle in the construction of mathematical knowledge. We introduce our problem within this area and provide a rationale for our research methodology, not avoiding its drawbacks, but rather giving examples of the kinds of difficulties we encountered. The paper highlights the integrated nature of the social, cultural and linguistic aspects of mathematics teaching and learning, and illustrates the fact that, even if the mathematical language can be considered universal, the language of `doing mathematics within the classroom' is far from being universal.</ab>

        <ab>Wireless networks are fast becoming ubiquitous in all aspects of society and the world economy. We describe a method for studying the impacts of combining such technology with dynamic, representationally-rich mathematics software, particularly on participation, expression and projection of identity from a local to a public, shared workspace. We describe the types of mathematical activities that can utilize such unique combinations of technologies. We outline specific discourse analytic methods for measuring participation and methodologies for incorporating measures of identity and participation into impact studies.</ab>

        <ab>The author reported research findings from a study that critically examined the role of sociocultural orientations in the mathematical experiences of 2 African American students. To determine how the orientations influenced the students' mathematical success, the author used a phenomenological research strategy to examine the life histories of the students. The author highlighted the African American students' perceptions of and responses to their mathematical experiences by emphasizing their experiences in mathematics classrooms. Results of the study suggest that the ways in which students perceive and respond to schooling influence their success in mathematics. Data also suggest that African American students do not perceive and respond to schooling in the same way by virtue of being African American, thus implying that African American students may belong to many different culture s. Finally, the results of the study suggest that the ways in which African American students view (a) membership in particular cultures, (b) caring educators, and (c) role models influence their mathematical success.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, we introduce the lexical bundle, defined by corpus linguists as a group of three or more words that frequently recur together, in a single group, in a particular register (Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, &amp; Finegan, ; Cortes, English for Specific Purposes 23:397–423, ). Attention to lexical bundles helps to explore hegemonic practices in mathematics classrooms because lexical bundles play an important role in structuring discourse and are often treated as “common sense” ways of interacting. We narrow our findings and discussion to a particular type of lexical bundle (called a “stance bundle” or bundles that relate to feelings, attitudes, value judgments, or assessments) because it was the most significant type found. Through comparing our corpus from secondary mathematics classrooms with two other corpora (one from university classrooms (not including mathematics classrooms) and one from conversations), we show that most of the stance bundles were particular to secondary mathematics classrooms. The stance bundles are interpreted through the lens of interpersonal positioning, drawing on ideas from systemic functional linguistics. We conclude by suggesting additional research that might be done, discussing limitations of this work, and pointing out that the findings warrant further attention to interpersonal positioning in mathematics classrooms.</ab>

        <ab>Novice teachers often have difficulty transferring what they learn in teacher education programs to classroom practice. This is especially true for elementary school teachers who are expected to teach mathematics with reform-oriented methods. The purpose of this longitudinal case study was to examine the experience of one novice elementary school teacher over a 3-year period, and understand the factors that supported her to enact a reform-oriented practice in mathematics as she transitioned from being a preservice to inservice teacher. Influential mathematics education models, her commitment to learning, and school-based contexts affected her teaching identity and practices. To conclude, an argument is made for teacher education experiences to explicitly address mathematics teacher identity to support the enactment of reform-oriented practices.</ab>

        <ab>The practices of mathematics education can be investigated at a wide variety of levels: from the actions of individual students or teachers through classroom interactions, school structures, curriculum specifications and materials, teacher development programmes and local, national or international systems of instruction and assessment. These levels are, however, inter-related. The study of a national curriculum gains significance as we see how it impacts upon and is interpreted by teachers and students. The study of an individual's actions makes more sense when these are interpreted in light of the broader context within which the individual is situated. This article is a version of a plenary lecture presented at the Psychology of Mathematics Education conference in 2009, addressing the conference theme 'In Search for Theories in Mathematics Education'. In it, I trace the development of my own search for theories to address my wish to understand practices in the field and suggest some tools from linguistics, critical discourse analysis and social theory that can help to make such connections between the various levels of investigation, illustrating with a range of examples.</ab>

        <ab>Context personalization—the incorporation of students’ out-of-school interests into learning tasks—has recently been shown to positively affect students’ situational interest and their performance and learning in mathematics. However, few studies have shown effects on both interest and achievement, drawing into question whether context personalization interventions can achieve both ends. The effects of personalization are theorized to result from activation of students’ prior knowledge of personal interests and generation of situational interest in math tasks, though theorists have begun to question whether situational interest serves as a mechanism by which learning outcomes are achieved. This experimental study examines whether personalizing 4 units of algebra problems that high school students (N = 150) solve in an intelligent tutoring system could improve their performance in units (i.e., accuracy and learning efficiency) and on classroom exams, whether adolescents who solved personalized problems would report greater situational interest in units (and later, individual interest in math) than peers who solved standard problems, and whether paths through situational interest would contribute to effects of personalization on outcomes. High school students in the personalization condition reported greater triggered situational interest in experimental units, and triggered interest predicted in-tutor outcomes (accuracy, learning efficiency). A total effect of personalization was also observed on classroom exam performance and individual interest in mathematics. Implications for theories of interest and context personalization are discussed, as are implications for math instruction and design of personalized learning environments.

        <ab>Educational Impact and Implications Statement—Context personalization refers to an instructional design strategy that incorporates students’ out-of-school interests into learning tasks like math problems. Recent research has shown that personalization positively affects students’ situational interest and their performance and learning in math, but students seldom obtain both outcomes. This study confirmed that personalizing 4 units of algebra story problems to students’ out-of-school interests was sufficient to increase their situational interest in the task and to improve the efficiency with which they solved problems within the intelligent tutoring system. Months later, those who solved personalized problems also reported greater interest in mathematics and scored higher on a classroom math test than a control group. These results extend evidence for the benefits of personalization and confirm that personalizing problems to incorporate student interests at an appropriate depth and specificity can simultaneously produce effects on math interest and learning.

        <ab>Many adolescent learners have difficulty understanding the relevance of mathematics for their lives. This problem is particularly pernicious among Black and Latino adolescents who often face cultural stigma that can affect their perceived value of mathematics. The present study used concurrent nested mixed methods to explore this issue in 419 urban Black and Latino adolescents. Structured classroom observations, a computerized cognitive assessment, and surveys were used to examine how teacher math applications (TMAs) and adolescent cognitive flexibility interact to predict students’ valuing of mathematics. From a subset of the larger sample (n = 37), semistructured qualitative interviews were used to understand how these adolescents came to view mathematics as a transformative tool in their lives, particularly in the face of cultural stigma. The quantitative results revealed that TMAs were associated with students’ value of mathematics. However, these results also illustrated how TMAs interacted with adolescent cognitive flexibility to predict students’ growth in valuing mathematics over the school year. The qualitative interviews corroborated the quantitative findings, but also revealed 3 themes that extended the quantitative results, uncovering racialized facets of valuing mathematics. The 3 themes that emerged were: utility orientations, alternative messengers, and resisting stigma and protecting collective identity. Altogether, these results demonstrated the role real-world applications, race, and adolescent cognition can have in urban mathematics classrooms. These findings suggest teachers’ sensitivity to these issues can support Black and Latino adolescents’ persistence in mathematics and understanding of self.

        <ab>Educational Impact and Implications Statement—This study suggests that teacher messages about the real-world relevance of mathematics matters in shaping how urban Black and Latino adolescents value mathematics. However, this study showed math teachers infrequently connected their instruction to the real world. To support adolescents’ value of mathematics, teachers need to better understand how to use real-world applications in the classroom that are sensitive to race, context, and adolescent cognition.

        <ab>Macroeconomic forces, globalization, transnational capital flight, and massive migration have global and local reverberations that affect our classrooms, teachers, communities, and students. In particular, teaching and learning mathematics in multiple language contexts is affected by these broader dynamics. Thus, politicizing the discussion around language usage is not a choice mathematics educators have the luxury of making-circumstances dictate that for us. This brief commentary responds to the six articles in the present volume and situates them within the larger sociopolitical context we live in today. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>This report describes four preservice secondary teachers' fictional accounts about mathematics classrooms. The narrative structures and meanings of the preservice teachers' stories, written while the preservice teachers were enrolled in a secondary methods course, were examined with the goal of gaining insight into the preservice teachers' emerging identities as mathematics teachers. Although past research has examined experienced teachers' stories, little research, if any, has focused on stories written by preservice mathematics teachers or on intentionally fictional stories about mathematics classrooms. This report uses methods of narrative analysis to develop understandings about preservice teachers' storied identities and specifies areas for further investigation into the role of narrative in mathematics teacher education.

        <ab>The authors describe research on the extent to which mathematics classroom activities in Maryland were aligned with Maryland learning outcomes and the Maryland School Performance Assessment Program (MSPAP; Maryland State Department of Education, 1995, 2000). The study was part of a larger research project (S. Lane, C. S. Parke, &amp; C. A. Stone, 1999) that focused on the overall impact of MSPAP on schools, teachers, and students. The authors collected 3,948 instruction, assessment, and test-preparation activities from a statewide stratified random sample of 250 teachers in the tested grades (3, 5, and 8) and nontested grades (2, 4, and 7). The authors describe the methods used to collect, code, and analyze teachers' classroom activities concerning 7 components: (a) mathematics process outcomes; (b) mathematics content outcomes; (c) student response types; (d) interpretation of charts, tables, and graphs; (e) use of manipulatives and calculators; (f) integration with other subject areas; and (g) overall similarity to MSPAP. They also highlight results for overall degree of alignment as well as differences in alignment across grade levels and type of activity (instruction vs. assessment). Most classroom activities aligned with aspects of state assessment and standards. Only minimal differences occurred across grades. However, degree of alignment was higher for instruction than assessment activities. This research approach can be useful to other educators and researchers interested in studying alignment among standards, assessment, and instruction. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>The nature of mathematical objects, their various types, the way in which they are formed, and how they participate in mathematical activity are all questions of interest for philosophy and mathematics education. Teaching in schools is usually based, implicitly or explicitly, on a descriptive/realist view of mathematics, an approach which is not free from potential conflicts. After analysing why this view is so often taken and pointing out the problems raised by realism in mathematics this paper discusses a number of philosophical alternatives in relation to the nature of mathematical objects. Having briefly described the educational and philosophical problem regarding the origin and nature of these objects we then present the main characteristics of a pragmatic and anthropological semiotic approach to them, one which may serve as the outline of a philosophy of mathematics developed from the point of view of mathematics education. This approach is able to explain from a non-realist position how mathematical objects emerge from mathematical practices.</ab>

        <ab>Reviews the book 'In Search of a Pedagogy of Conflict and Dialogue for Mathematics Education,' by Renuka Vithal (2003). This book presents an honest portrayal of an interrogation of the question: 'What happens in a mathematics classroom when student teachers attempt to realise a social, cultural, political approach to a school mathematics curriculum, particularly one that integrates a critical perspective?' In the first section of the book, the author traces the emergence, with origins in the 1980s, of a social/cultural/political approach to mathematics education with roots in critical mathematics education; ethnomathematics; universal concerns with gender, race, class, and equity. A major strength of this book, is that it challenges the view that mathematics education can be isolated from the political context in which it is taking place. This book is recommended reading for those who believe that radical change is needed in the conceptualization of mathematics education, and even more highly recommended for those who do not. The book interrogates issues of what mathematics education is for-in particular, and what its ethical responsibilities are. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>This paper discusses fairness and equity in assessment of mathematics. The increased importance of teachers' interpretative judgments of students' performance in highstakes assessments and in the classroom has prompted this exploration. Following a substantial theoretical overview of the field, the issues are illustrated by two studies that took place in the context of a reformed mathematics curriculum in England. One study is of teachers' informal classroom assessment practices; the other is of their interpretation and evaluation of students' formal written mathematical texts (i.e., responses to mathematics problems). Results from both studies found that broadly similar work could be interpreted differently by different teachers. The formation of teachers' views of students and evaluation of their mathematical attainments appeared to be influenced by surface features of students' work and behavior and by individual teachers' prior expectations.

        <ab>We argue that dialogic theory, inspired by the Russian scholar Mikhail Bakhtin, has a distinct contribution to the analysis of the genesis of understanding in the mathematics classroom. We begin by contrasting dialogic theory to other leading theoretical approaches to understanding conceptual development in mathematics influenced by Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky. We argue that both Piagetian and Vygotskian traditions in mathematics education overlook important dialogic causal processes enabling or hindering switches in perspective between voices in relationship. To illustrate this argument, we use Piagetian-, Vygotskian- and Bakhtinian-inspired approaches to analyse a short extract of classroom data in which two 12-year-old boys using TinkerPlots software change their understanding of a probability problem. While all three analyses have something useful to offer, our dialogic analysis reveals aspects of the episode, in particular the significance of the emotional engagement and the laughter of the students, which are occluded by the other two approaches.</ab>

        <ab>Part of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' 1997 yearbook on multicultural and gender equity in the math classroom.  The writers discuss two ways in which ethnomathematics can become a tool for use in the mathematics classroom.  The two ways are for students to regard ethnomathematics as the mathematics practice of others and as their own mathematics practice.  By encouraging students to do mathematics that uses both others' mathematics practices and their own, math educators can assist students in making connections, developing deeper mathematical understandings, and expanding their beliefs about what mathematics is.</ab>

        <ab>Student opposition in school is traditionally cast in terms of individual dispositions, whereby particular students or groups of students are said to “resist” or “oppose” school structures and identities aligned with the dominant cultural group. The author examined instead how the teacher and students in a low-track mathematics classroom interaction revealed the mergence and escalation of a number of classroom practices that became oppositional. These practices were related to the nature of the mathematical activity the framing and positioning of student participation in this activity, and multiple interpretations of student competence in and out of the classroom. The author found that classroom opposition is fostered by weak opportunities for meaningful mathematical engagement and the transformation of polarized participation structure into an oppositional one.</ab>

        <ab>To learn mathematical practices, students need opportunities to engage in them. But simply providing such opportunities may not be sufficient to support all students. Simultaneously, explicitly teaching mathematical practices could be problematic if instruction becomes prescriptive. This study investigated how teachers might make mathematical practices explicit in classroom discourse. Analyses of 26 discussions from 3 mathematics classes revealed that teachers made mathematical practices explicit primarily after students had participated in them. I present a framew'ork of 8 types of teacher moves that made mathematical practices explicit and argue that they did so without turning practices into prescriptions or reducing students' opportunities to engage in them. This suggests a need to expand conceptions of explicitness to promote access to mathematical practices.</ab>

        <ab>Mathematics education at the high school level is not working for many students. Although there has been steady improvement in mathematics learning at the elementary and middle school levels across the United States, for the past decade, student achievement has remained essentially flat at the high school level (NCES 2015, 2016). One possible reason is that the shift at the elementary level to instructional pedagogies that build on student thinking and engage students in mathematical discourse have been slow to find their way into high school classrooms. Teachers build the foundation in the elementary grades to launch students on their mathematical journeys. Therefore, it is important for them to keep an eye on the mathematical horizon for their students, be aware of future expectations, and work toward a consistent pre-K-12 vision of mathematics teaching and learning. The purpose of this article is to review "Catalyzing Change in High School Mathematics: Initiating Critical Conversations" (NCTM 2018), which calls for fundamental changes in the way high school students experience mathematics. It also examines the implications for teachers. The author begins by listing the four major recommendations for high schools and then elaborate on key messages. These include a need for equitable instruction that fosters positive mathematical identities and agency as well as a need for equitable structures, such as elimination of tracking and creation of a common course pathway. She closes with next steps for collaborative conversations and actions.</ab>

        <ab>The authors investigated the use of a particular discourse practice--continued questioning and discussion after a correct answer was provided, which they called extended discourse--and examined the frequency and content of this practice in 17 Chinese and 14 U.S. elementary mathematics classes. They found that the Chinese classrooms had more, and spent more time in, extended discourse than did the U.S. classrooms. The content of these episodes differed: The Chinese classrooms focused more on rules and procedures than did the U.S. classrooms, whereas the U.S. classrooms focused more on computation than did the Chinese classrooms. These findings shed light on interesting practices of discourse in both countries and also have implications for current U.S. reforms in mathematics pedagogy.

        <ab>Confidence assessment (CA), in which students state alongside each of their answers a confidence level expressing how certain they are, has been employed successfully within higher education. However, it has not been widely explored with school pupils. This study examined how school mathematics pupils ( N = 345) in five different secondary schools in England responded to the use of a CA instrument designed to incentivise the eliciting of truthful confidence ratings in the topic of directed (positive and negative) numbers. Pupils readily understood the negative marking aspect of the CA process and their facility correlated with their mean confidence with r = .546, N = 336, p &lt; .001, indicating that pupils were generally well calibrated. Pupils' comments indicated that the vast majority were positive about the CA approach, despite its dramatic differences from more usual assessment practices in UK schools. Some pupils felt that CA promoted deeper thinking, increased their confidence and had a potential role to play in classroom formative assessment.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, studies done on gender in Botswana's classrooms at the junior secondary level, are reported.  The initial studies were more quantitative in nature, and dealt with questioning as part of classroom interaction.  The studies revealed other gender related issues however, which were observed in more detail later.  With the participating teachers, the findings were discussed and a plan for reform in their teaching was drawn up.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>Although scholarly debates about what should be expected of Black male teachers are increasing in a landscape where they represent around 2%, understanding how a Black male teacher talks about his culturally responsive practices and what he actually does in the classroom with his students in an urban context provides potentially transferable features for other educators. This study captures a middle school, Black male math and science teacher's validation of his students--a tenet of Gay's culturally responsive pedagogy framework. Drawing from culturally responsive pedagogy as an analytic tool, the purpose of this study is to understand and describe this teacher's practices, shedding light on them with examples of his discursive insights and interactions that move the theory of culturally responsive pedagogy into the actual practice of it.</ab>

        <ab>Based on the 1993 California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) Middle Grades Mathematics Performance Assessment, an innovative alternative assessment, the study explores whether all schools, regardless of the cultural, ethnic, or socioeconomic background of the students they serve, provide students with equal opportunity to learn that which is assessed.  Opportunity to learn was defined to include a range of variables likely to influence student performance, including access to resources, access to high-quality instructional content and processes, extra-school opportunities, and direct preparation for the CLAS.  Data collection efforts included teacher interviews, student surveys, student retrospective think-aloud interviews, and classroom observations of the assessment administration.  Researchers chose 13 schools across the state to represent three broad categories of schools:  affluent suburban; low-socioecnomic-status (SES) urban; and remote, mixed SES rural schools.  Findings highlight some differences between school types in various opportunity-to-learn measures and suggest directions for future research.

        <ab>Technology is available and accessible in many mathematics classrooms. Adopting technology to support teaching and learning requires teachers to change their teaching practices. This paper reports the responses of a diverse cohort of 92 secondary mathematics teachers who chose to respond to an Australian state-wide survey (Mathematics with Technology Perceptions Survey) developed using a Theory of Planned Behaviour framework. The items discussed in this paper targeted mathematics teachers’ perceptions of possible barriers and enablers to their intention to use technology in their teaching. The responses are varied but, overall, strength of agreement with enablers outweighed agreement with perceived barriers. However, it is clear that despite an overall positive attitude towards the use of technology for teaching mathematics, some perceived barriers to change are notable. It is, therefore, helpful if those responsible for professional development, promoting the use of technology, recognise and address these barriers as well as working to strengthening enablers.</ab>

        <ab>This study assessed the effects of small-group tutoring with and without validated classroom instruction on at-risk students' math problem solving. Stratifying within schools, 119 3rd-grade classes were randomly assigned to conventional or validated problem-solving instruction (Hot Math, schema-broadening instruction). Students identified as at risk (n=243) were randomly assigned, within classroom conditions, to receive or not receive Hot Math tutoring. Students were tested on problem-solving and math applications measures before and after 16 weeks of intervention. Analyses of variance, which accounted for the nested structure of the data, revealed that the tutored students who received validated classroom instruction achieved better than the tutored students who received conventional classroom instruction (effect size=1.34). However, the advantage for tutoring over no tutoring was similar whether students received validated or conventional classroom instruction (effect sizes=1.18 and 1.13). Tutoring, not validated classroom instruction, reduced the prevalence of math difficulty. Implications for responsiveness-to-intervention prevention models and for enhancing math problem-solving instruction are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Reviews the book, Learning Mathematics: Issues, Theory and Classroom Practice by Anthony Orton (2004). As the title suggests, this book does it all, albeit with limited treatment of any single idea. The author has a knack for taking abstract theoretical ideas, like situated cognition and constructivism, and cultivating them so that they can be meaningful to the teacher, not just the researcher. The book is an excellent text for a master's level course or simply a resource for preservice and practicing teachers. The author succeeds in providing a comprehensive and articulate coverage of learning mathematics and particular issues that are 'not only important in teaching but also the interaction between theory and practice'. It would have been nice to see the inclusion of certain additional contemporary topics, such as differing views of definitions of mathematics, standards, equity issues, and the integration of technology, yet it is certainly understandable as the author concedes that there are space constraints. Overall, the author has provided a manageable text for even preservice teachers to begin wrestling with the diverse and arduous topics in mathematics education.

        <ab>The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) are a focus of state education policy today influencing curriculum implementation and assessment in public schools. The purpose of this narrative inquiry is to understand how high school mathematics teachers experience the transition period. Based on interviews with mathematics teachers in a high school in the Midwest, we aim at bringing teachers' voices to the forefront. Through teachers' stories, we find that: a) Teachers live in the different zones of enactment; and b) Teachers' ecological view of agency should be used as a link to a transition to the CCSS for creating a genuine dialogue. This article is significant in two ways. First, it informs the administrators and policy makers of how there will be inconsistencies across states, districts, schools and classrooms in the implementation and assessment, and second, it helps to explain the need for new professional development approaches.</ab>

        <ab>Our primary purpose in this article is to propose an interpretive scheme for analyzing the identities that students develop in mathematics classrooms that can inform instructional design and teaching. We first introduce the key constructs of normative identity and personal identity, and then illustrate how they can be used to conduct empirical analyses. The case on which the sample analysis focuses concerns a single group of middle school students who were members of two contrasting classrooms in which what it meant to know and do mathematics differed significantly. The resulting analyses document the forms of agency that students can legitimately exercise in particular classrooms, together with how authority is distributed and thus to whom students are accountable, and what they are accountable for mathematically. In the final section of the article, we clarify the relation of the interpretive scheme to other current work on the identities that students are developing in mathematics classrooms.</ab>

        <ab>This study evaluated the efficacy of a preschool mathematics program based on a comprehensive model of developing research-based software and print curricula. Building Blocks, funded by the National Science Foundation, is a curriculum development project focused on creating research-based, technology-enhanced mathematics materials for pre-K through grade 2. In this article, we describe the underlying principles, development, and initial summative evaluation of the first set of resulting materials as they were used in classrooms with children at risk for later school failure. Experimental and comparison classrooms included two principal types of public preschool programs serving low-income families: state funded and Head Start prekindergarten programs. The experimental treatment group score increased significantly more than the comparison group score; achievement gains of the experimental group approached the sought-after 2-sigma effect of individual tutoring. This study contributes to research showing that focused early mathematical interventions help young children develop a foundation of informal mathematics knowledge, especially for children at risk for later school failure.

        <ab>Background/Context: School tracking practices have been documented repeatedly as having negative effects on students’ identity development and attainment, particularly for those students placed in lower tracks. Despite this documentation, tracking persists as a normative practice in American high schools, perhaps in part because we have few models of how departments and teachers can successfully organize instruction in heterogeneous, high school mathematics classes. This paper offers one such model through a qualitative and quantitative analysis. Focus of Study: In an effort to better the field’s understanding of equitable and successful teaching, we conducted a longitudinal study of three high schools. At one school, Railside, students demonstrated greater gains in achievement than students at the other two schools and higher overall achievement on a number of measures. Furthermore, achievement gaps among various ethnic groups at Railside that were present on incoming assessments disappeared in nearly all cases by the end of the second year. This paper provides an analysis of Railside’s success and identifies factors that contributed to this success. Participants: Participants included approximately 700 students as they progressed through three California high schools. Railside was an urban high school with an ethnically, linguistically, and economically diverse student body. Greendale was situated in a coastal community with a more homogeneous, primarily White student body. Hilltop was a rural high school with primarily White and Latino/a students. Research Design: This longitudinal, multiple case study employed mixed methods. Three schools were chosen to offer a range of curricular programs and varied student populations. Student achievement and attitudinal data were evaluated using statistical techniques, whereas teacher and student practices were documented using qualitative analytic techniques such as coding. Findings/Results: One of the findings of the study was the success of Railside school, where the mathematics department taught heterogeneous classes using a reform-oriented approach. Compared with the other two schools in the study, Railside students learned more, enjoyed mathematics more and progressed to higher mathematics levels. This paper presents large-scale evidence of these important achievements and provides detailed analyses of the ways that the Railside teachers brought them about, with a focus on the teaching and learning interactions within the classrooms.

        <ab>The interaction patterns of teachers and students in public and private urban schools was investigated specifically to explore higher order teacher questioning. On the basis of a review of the literature, the authors speculated that patterns of student response to higher order teacher questioning would differ by student gender. Higher order questioning encourages students to think critically, and, therefore, is powerful for learning. Lower order questioning, however, taps only the memorization of facts. The results from this study suggested no gender difference in students' responses to higher order questioning. The 16 teachers observed used predominately lower level questioning patterns in their classrooms. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>Imagine a math classroom that recognizes the power of mathematics and uses it as a tool to understand the world so that the mathematics can enjoin a larger conversation. What is it like to live on a minimum wage? How is wealth distributed throughout the country or world? When will a country first experience a shortage of food? Mathematics education has the potential to help students understand their lives and surroundings and see math as instrumental in making the world more equitable and just (Gutstein and Peterson 2006). In this article, the author discusses the definition of Human Rights Education (HRE) and gives an example of how it can be applied to resources that already exist within the mathematics classroom. Felisa Tibbitts, in "Understanding What We Do: Emerging Models for Human Rights Education," suggests using three models for teaching HRE: (1) The Values and Awareness Model; (2) the Accountability Model; and (3) the Transformational Model. The Values and Awareness Model focuses on providing students with basic knowledge of human rights issues (Tibbitts 2002). Herein, the author demonstrates an example of a first-year algebra lesson that uses the Values and Awareness Model.</ab>

        <ab>Researchers and theorists in education have offered persuasive arguments and evidence documenting the need for, and benefits of, education for social justice. Despite these efforts the intersection of social justice with interdisciplinary curricular designs remains underexplored. This article argues that social justice education is enriched through interdisciplinary curricula, in that it holds the potential for students to develop deeper conceptions of social justice and experience deeper learning outcomes related to content knowledge across subject matter areas. Central to this argument is the notion that situating disciplinary relationships explicitly within social justice perspectives encourages an emphasis on broader and richer sociopolitical consciousness among learners. We draw on historical and contemporary narratives to position social justice in mathematics and social studies education. As researchers in these two fields, we envision greater possibilities for the advancement of knowledge, and we envision learning from inequalities and resisting oppression by nurturing deeper, more explicit connections between mathematics and social studies. We conclude this article with three overviews of learning segments as potential representations of interdisciplinary mathematics-social studies for social justice work in secondary school contexts.</ab>

        <ab>Developing the idea of a critical equity lens, the writer discusses various important considerations for efforts to achieve the vision of mathematics learning outlined in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics, a 2000 publication from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.  She argues that realization of this vision will require ongoing examination of education in mathematics through the dual lenses of equity and learning.  Moreover, the writer suggests that such an examination must take place at the classroom level as well as at broader policy levels.</ab>

        <ab>As student engagement in science learning continues to garner significant attention from educational researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, the importance of understanding person and context-related factors that impact student engagement is increasingly recognized. In this mixed methods study, middle school students’ (N = 1,848) engagement was examined in relation to opportunities to participate in science learning (OtP in science) from 29 schools in the United States. Drawing on the ecological systems and opportunity-propensity frameworks, multilevel structural equation modeling was applied to test the relationship between OtP in science and student engagement, accounting for student (gender, grade, ethnicity) and school (socioeconomic status) factors. Results showed that at the student level, OtP in science was a statistically significant predictor of engagement, and this relationship varied by school. In addition, school SES predicted school-average OtP in science, and there was a statistically significant cross-level interaction for school SES, in that the relationship between OtP in science and engagement was stronger for schools with higher SES. In the qualitative phase, 6 student focus group interviews were analyzed to develop explanatory accounts for the quantitative results. Collaborative hands-on activities, peer-to-peer discourse, and positive teacher and student relationships were identified as social processes that facilitated students’ propensity to engage in the science learning opportunities. Factors related to school SES that explain the link between OtP in science and student engagement are also described. Taken together, our findings provide a more complete picture of how students’ engagement in science relates to person and context-related factors and hold theoretical and practical implications for the study of engagement in diverse classrooms.

        <ab>In underscoring the affective elements of mathematics experience, we work with contemporary readings of the work of Spinoza on the politics of affect, to understand what is included in the cognitive repertoire of the Subject. We draw on those resources to tell a pedagogical tale about the relation between cognition and affect in settings of mathematical learning. Our interest is first captured in the way in which one teacher's priority of establishing an inclusive learning community occasionally harboured what appeared to be pedagogically restrictive conceptions of mathematics. Yet, the classroom practices that produced these conceptions promoted the students' motivation and provided meaningful access to mathematical learning within the classroom collectivity. In a second example, the postponement of scientific encapsulation in bodily imitations of planetary movement kept alive a shared dynamic sense of an elliptical orbit. In both of these cases, we draw on Spinoza's work to show how the affectivity of classroom practice constituted conceptions of cognition and of mathematical activity crucially linked to the imperatives of participation.</ab>

        <ab>The field of mathematics education research has seen a resurgence of interest in understanding collaborative learning because students in K-12 classrooms are increasingly expected to make sense of mathematics problems together. This research commentary argues for the importance of understanding student authority relations in collaborative mathematics classrooms. How intellectual authority becomes constructed, organized, and distributed among students has implications for both mathematics learning and the development of mathematics-linked identities. This research commentary suggests directions for future work to gain clarity' on the mechanisms that undergird the distribution of authority in order to support powerful mathematics classrooms.</ab>

        <ab>This study examined whether or not embodied-agent-based learning would help middle-grade females have more positive mathematics learning experiences. The study used an explanatory mixed methods research design. First, a classroom-based experiment was conducted with one hundred twenty 9th graders learning introductory algebra (53% male and 47% female; 51% Caucasian and 49% Latino). The results revealed that learner gender was a significant factor in the learners’ evaluations of their agent (η² = .07), the learners’ task-specific attitudes (η² = .05), and their task-specific self-efficacy (η² = .06). In-depth interviews were then conducted with 22 students selected from the experiment participants. The interviews revealed that Latina and Caucasian females built a different type of relationship with their agent and reported more positive learning experiences as compared with Caucasian males. The females’ favorable view of the agent-based learning was largely influenced by their everyday classroom experiences, implying that students’ learning experience in real and virtual spaces was interconnected.

        <ab>Some researchers have expressed doubts about the potential of reform-oriented curricula to promote equity. This article considers this important issue and argues that investigations into equitable teaching must pay attention to the particular practices of teaching and learning that are enacted in classrooms. Data are presented from two studies in which middle school and high school teachers using reform-oriented mathematics curricula achieved a reduction in linguistic, ethnic, and class inequalities in their schools. The teaching and learning practices that these teachers employed were central to the attainment of equality, suggesting that it is critical that relational analyses of equity go beyond the curriculum to include the teacher and their teaching.

        <ab>A study investigated whether racially diverse high schools offer equal educational opportunities to students from different racial and ethnic groups.  Data were obtained from two samples of racially diverse high schools:  one sample was composed of African Americans, Caucasians and Asians from 26 schools with 3,149 students and the other was composed of Latinos, Caucasians, and Asians from 22 schools with 2,775 students.  Findings reveal that schools varied in the extent to which African American and Latino students were underrepresented in advanced math sophomore classes.  This pattern of racial inequality in schools is related to lower minority senior-year grades and enrollment in 4-year postsecondary institutions, net of students' own background.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special issue on communication in mathematics, K–12 and beyond.  Central to the current vision of desirable mathematics teaching are communication and discourse.  Students are expected to engage in doing mathematics while actively participating in a “discourse community.”  The process of creating mathematical discourse communities is a challenge, because it is a complex, multifaceted undertaking.  Educators face the challenges of encouraging students to participate and of centering discourse on worthwhile mathematical ideas.  To meet these challenges, educators need to learn math in a way that emphasizes discourse; need a broad, deep, and flexible knowledge of content and pedagogical alternatives; and need to feel that they are working in safe and supportive environments.  These suggestions are based on the Quantitative Understanding:  Amplifying Student Achievement and Reasoning project.</ab>

        <ab>We respond to a call to analyze issues of curriculum standards and to present alternative storylines by addressing criticisms of the Common Core State Standards in early childhood. We describe a storyline from multiple media and evaluate this storyline's criticisms, focusing on the criticism that the standards are developmentally inappropriate. We review research and conclude that the criticism is invalid and may reflect a historical belief in the primacy of development over learning rather than the research record. Misinterpreting or ignoring relevant research has equity consequences because it may particularly harm those children most in need of learning support in learning grade-level mathematics. Fortunately, theory and research illuminate learning trajectories that help all children meet these standards.</ab>

        <ab>The effects of 3 instructional methods on mathematical reasoning were investigated. The methods are (a) cooperative learning embedded within multilevel metacognitive training (MMT), (b) cooperative learning embedded within unilevel metacognitive training (UMT), and (c) learning in the whole class with no metacognitive training. MMT was implemented in mathematics and English classrooms; UMT was used only in mathematics classrooms; and the whole class with no metacognitive training served as a control group. Results indicated that students who were exposed to MMT significantly outperformed their counterparts who were exposed to UMT who, in turn, significantly outperformed the control group. Effects of MMT were observed on students while they solved mathematical problems. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Although female students’ overall performance in mathematics is on a par with the performance of male students, female students tend to report lower levels of mathematics self-concept (MSC) than their male schoolmates. With the present study, we examined for the first time whether occupational gender diversity (i.e., a balanced gender ratio) in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) statistically predicted students’ MSC beyond well-established sources of self-concept formation as described in the big-fish-little-pond effect framework. To this end, we applied linear mixed-effects models to large, representative data sets comprising 120,270 students from 23 countries. After controlling for individual-level and school-level achievement, we found an interaction between students’ gender and country-level STEM gender diversity, with female students reporting higher MSC in countries characterized by greater gender diversity. Our results therefore suggest that a lack of societal STEM gender diversity negatively affects female students’ MSC formation and that good mathematics performance in itself does not protect female students from this adverse trend. We interpret our findings against the background of self-concept theory and research as well as psychological theories of gendered socialization.

        <ab>Educational Impact and Implications Statement: In our study, we examined gender differences in students’ mathematics self-concept (MSC)—that is, their perception of their own mathematics ability—across 23 countries. Whereas female and male students tend to perform similarly well in mathematics, female students tend to rate their own mathematics ability considerably lower than their male counterparts do in almost all countries. Our results revealed that the ratio of women to men in scientific, technical, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) research jobs in a country was significantly related to female students’ MSC, but this finding did not hold for the male students. Female students reported lower MSCs when they lived in countries in which female scientists were scarce—regardless of the female students’ mathematics achievement. High achievement in mathematics alone thus does not seem to be sufficient for improving female students’ MSC in societies with gender inequities in STEM, further indicating the need to enhance gender diversity in STEM fields around the world in order to provide role models for girls and women.

        <ab>Student teaching is often a capstone experience in the preparation of mathematics teachers. Thus, it is essential to better understand key aspects of the experience. We conducted a qualitative study of post-lesson conferences led by supervisors (classroom cooperating teachers and a university supervisor) working with mathematics student teachers. Analysis of conference communications revealed differences in the types and content of communications in conferences led by the cooperating teachers and by the university supervisor. Cooperating teachers tended toward evaluative supervision that lacked a focus on the mathematics of the lessons while the university supervisor tended toward educative supervision, guiding student teachers to reflect on and learn from their own classroom experiences including the mathematics of their lessons. Differences are discussed, and suggestions concerning the supervision of student teachers are made along with recommendations for further research.</ab>

        <ab>Research on secondary students' academic, behavioral/motivational, and attitudinal outcomes is reviewed in order to evaluate the conceptual foundations of teaching for social justice and provide a framework for teaching social justice in K–12 classrooms.  Findings suggest that a systemic approach to educational reform is required in order to address educational inequity.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special issue on equity, mathematics reform, and research. The writer examines the mathematics performance of African-American students against the larger context of mathematics teaching and learning in schools in the U.S.  The distortion and mystification of mathematics and its uses in the U.S. have contributed to its positioning as an unattainable and undesirable goal.  However, in the current extremely technological global economy, few Americans can afford to be left out of high-level mathematics.  Unfortunately, that is what is happening to African-American students.  Schools with a majority of African-American students have less extensive and demanding mathematics programs and offer less opportunities for students to take gatekeeper courses like calculus and algebra that lead to increased opportunities at the college level and beyond.  The challenge of bettering the mathematical performance of African-American students must confronted on a programmatic, personal, and political front.</ab>

        <ab>In this study, we investigated effects of the proportion of language minority students in classrooms on the development of students’ intrinsic motivation in language lessons and the mediating role of instructional climate (e.g., teacher support, focus on student interests). In addition, we explored the interaction between the proportion of language minority students and individual language background affecting students’ motivation. Analyses were based on data collected in 352 German 9th-grade classrooms across 2 measurement points in a multilevel framework. We found that students in classrooms with a higher proportion of language minority students were more intrinsically motivated to learn. However, we found no statistical evidence for the prediction that the compositional effect should be mediated by the instructional climate in the classroom. Cross-level interaction analyses revealed that only language minority students were increasingly motivated in classrooms with a higher proportion of language minority students. Our findings add to the growing evidence indicating that the nature and quality of the social environment are important determinants of school-related motivation.

        <ab>The Thinking with Data project (TWD) expands on current notions of data literacy by (1) focusing on proportional reasoning as key to data literacy and (2) leveraging the non-mathematics disciplines to engage students in deep thinking about the context of data and the application of proportionality. A set of four 2-week, sequential modules for cross-disciplinary implementation in seventh-grade classrooms was designed and evaluated. Using a quasi-experimental approach, we found that student data literacy was increased through the focused integration of social studies, mathematics, science, and English language arts. In this article, we describe our theoretical approach to designing and implementing the modules, report on student learning gains in mathematics, and describe teacher reactions to the materials. In sum, our study provides evidence that the TWD approach has the potential to build data literacy while also allowing students to learn core discipline-based content standards.</ab>

        <ab>This study used qualitative methods to investigate the teaching of high school mathematics teachers teaching in tracked schools. A comparison between two tracked classes, one honors class and one regular class, was done for each of two participants. The study addressed the following research questions: (1) How do the teachers construct the two tracked groups of students as different? (2) How do teachers adjust their teaching practice for two different tracked classrooms? The findings suggested that in between-participant comparisons, teachers made similar associations between poor behavior and lack of motivation with the regular-track students. Differences in pedagogical approaches in the two classes were directly related to these associations.</ab>

        <ab>How the use of computers in mathematics classrooms was viewed by students in two middle years mathematics classrooms was the focus of the research described in this paper. The primary data sources consisted of questionnaires, classroom observations supported by videotaping of mathematics lessons, and interviews with two girls and two boys from each class. Thus both qualitative and quantitative methods were used. Girls viewed the computer-based lessons less favourably than did boys. In general, the boys were likely to believe that computers contributed to their experiencing pleasure in these lessons, and to making mathematics more relevant to them. Girls were typically more concerned about whether computers facilitated learning and enabled success in mathematics. The attitudes of students to computer-based mathematics were related to their views of computers.</ab>

        <ab>This research effort reports the findings of an empirical study focusing on the ways in which technological tools are implemented specifically in mathematics education in a Title I school. The purpose was to identify the perspectives and actions of the school’s mathematics specialist and the multi-graded (grades 2–3) classroom teacher as they attempted to deliver instruction with technology for both English Language Learners1 (ELL) and non-ELL students. Findings showed that a critical factor in access to mathematics education and technology for ELL students in a multi-graded 2–3 classroom in a Title I (K-5) school setting was language. Although potentially powerful technologies—analog (concrete objects) and digital (software) were used, many ELL students could not access the content solely because of language difficulties. Teachers used the concrete objects as modeling tools, to reveal students’ thinking, and for communication of foundational mathematics. Conversely, the software used served none of these functions because the available software did not do the kinds of things the manipulatives did, teachers’ knowledge of exemplary software was insufficient, the school used an impoverished model of technology integration, and teachers were constrained by the school district’s policies of English immersion for ELL students.</ab>

        <ab>ABSTRACT Multiple research methods from different paradigms were used in this interpretive study to explore the nature of classroom environments in a cross-national study involving Taiwan and Australia. When English and Mandarin versions of a questionnaire assessing student perceptions of 7 dimensions of the classroom learning environment were administered to 50 classes in each country, data analysis supported the reliability and factorial validity of the questionnaire and revealed differences between Taiwanese and Australian classroom environments. The data provided a starting point from which other methods (such as observations, interviews, and narrative stories) were used to gain a more in-depth understanding of the classroom environments in each country. Findings are represented in the form of stories and interpretive commentaries.</ab>

        <ab>From a sociocultural perspective an object of research on mathematics teaching and learning can be seen as a particular moment in the zoom of a lens. Researchers focus on a specific part of a complex process whilst taking account of the other views that would be obtained by pulling back or zooming in. Researching teaching and learning mathematics must be seen in the same way. Thus in zooming out researchers address the practices and meanings within which students become school-mathematical actors, whilst zooming in enables a study of mediation and of individual trajectories within the classroom. In each choice of object of research the range of other settings have to be incorporated into the analysis. Such analyses aim to embrace the complexity of the teaching-learning process. This article will present a cultural, discursive psychology for mathematics education that takes language and discursive practices as central in that meanings precede us and we are constituted within language and the associated practices, in the multiple settings within which we grow up and participate.</ab>

To that end, this article explores what is known about how individuals' racial identity influences their decision to enter the teaching profession. Based on a yearlong study conducted in a large school district serving primarily African American and Latino students, the article describes the motivations to teach for a cohort of alternatively prepared middle school mathematics and science teachers who have previous professional experience in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The study found that African American participants expressed their race as an initial motivation to teach whereas White participants came to realize the influence of race on their teaching experiences in the midst of their first year in the classroom.</ab>

        <ab>Student learning in the mathematics classroom is described as being both social and personal. Students' prior knowledge (human capital), attitudes (personal capital), and social skills and/or cultural values (sociocultural capital) are personal components they bring into the classroom. The purpose of this instrumental case study was to explore (a) the role of human resource capital as it relates to Black and Latino middle school students' engagement in a mathematics community of practice and (b) the impact of this engagement on their mathematics identities. Results suggest that these students bring rich human resource capital that links their out-of-school and in-school experiences, social interactions, and personal motivations. Educators are challenged to capitalize on Black and Latino students human resource capital and mathematics identities in order to help lead students to mathematical understanding.

        <ab>Background/Context: Open-ended, or implicit, questioning has been described as central to reform teaching in mathematics. However, concerns about equity have caused some researchers to question whether this kind of teaching is productive for all children. Purpose: This study explores the role that implicit and explicit questions played in encouraging mathematical thinking in an elementary mathematics class taught by a reform-oriented teacher. Setting: The study took place in a third-grade classroom located in a small urban school. Participants: Participants in the study were a European American teacher, a student teacher, and 19 third-grade students in an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse classroom. Research Design: The study drew on ethnographic interpretive methods to collect data through a yearlong observation of 5 focal students in the third-grade classroom. Conversations during mathematics class were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data also included written field notes, student work, informal interviews with children, and formal interviews with the teacher. Analysis began with open coding of the transcripts and field notes and proceeded to more fine-grained coding and examination of other data. Data Collection and Analysis: Analysis showed that implicit questions seemed to privilege some children, particularly those who shared the language and cultural practices of the teacher, whereas explicit questions allowed a wider variety of children to participate competently in the mathematics classroom.</ab>

        <ab>Culturally relevant pedagogy is not well understood as an instructional strategy in the mathematics classroom. This study reveals the challenges two teachers faced when they implemented a pilot project with ninth and tenth grade ESOL students. The task they envisioned as culturally relevant did not capture their ESOL students' interests; rather, it caused both teachers and students to wrestle with tensions around cultural relevance. The major finding of this study is teachers' beliefs and identities are complicated with CRP. Specifically, it changed two teachers' beliefs about teaching mathematics and their role in the mathematics classroom. It also informed the teacher-researcher about the needs of teachers prior to implementing CRP. Although the task allowed ESOL students to acquire specific knowledge and to develop critical consciousness, it did little to enhance their cultural competence. Understanding the nuances of CRP will help teachers to better operationalize it (Morrison, Bobbins, &amp; Rose, 2008). Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</ab>

        <ab>The main focus here is to examine the benefits of defining and developing an engineering curriculum for elementary schools. Like many other international educational systems, Australian educational settings have been seeking to effectively implement science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. However, current assumptions and expectations of STEM education are broad, poorly defined and intangible. This article deliberates on possible contributions and impediments that are preventing teachers from achieving engineering education in their classrooms. Using positioning theory, this article offers possible ways that the specific literacies of engineering can be better realized in teacher practices. A closer alignment will be necessary between the visions and expectations of STEM education, as perceived by governments, business, industry, and schools, to ensure a realization of the potential of STEM education. Engineering education in elementary school settings warrants the investment of time to understand what it proffers, and to enable teachers to identity and refine their practices to optimize the many benefits afforded.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports on a workshop activity that mathematics coordinators, professional developers, and teacher leaders can use to help teachers plan accessibility strategies for teaching mathematics. The central premise of the workshop activity is based on the Equity Principle in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics. The challenge for teachers lies in applying this principle to daily classroom practice. Having a top-ten list of accommodations and strategies for working with students with special needs in mathematics is not enough.</ab>

        <ab>Reviews the book 'Which Way Social Justice in Mathematics Education?,' edited by Leone Burton (2003). In this text, mathematics educators from Australia, Austria, Germany, Peru, the United Kingdom, and the United States explore the meanings of such terms as equity and justice as well as examining issues of equity and justice in settings ranging from a small group to a classroom to a country. The differences in opportunity to learn mathematics between urban and rural settings in Peru and in gender participation in Malawi are among the more obvious forms of inequity reported. Other chapters explore more subtle forms of inequity, such as the way in which students with different thinking styles are more or less able to gain understanding from different types of presentations or interactions.

        <ab>A perceived lack of engagement of many students in middle years mathematics classes provides a challenge for educators. In this article we report a project that investigated students' perceptions of the extent to which their own efforts influence their achievement at mathematics and their life opportunities. We conducted 2 hour interviews with over 50 students, as well as collecting other data. The results suggest that a student's orientation to learning mathematics is not predicted by their achievement. Even students who were confident, successful and persistent exhibited short-term goals. It seems that classroom culture may be an important determinant of under-participation in schooling.</ab>

        <ab>This article reports on a 2-year study about teaching and learning mathematics for social justice in an urban, Latino classroom and about the role of an NCTM Standards-based curriculum. I was the teacher in the study and moved with the class from seventh to eighth grade. Using qualitative, practitioner-research methodology, I learned that students began to read the world (understand complex issues involving justice and equity) using mathematics, to develop mathematical power, and to change their orientation toward mathematics. A series of real-world projects was fundamental to this change, but the Standards-based curriculum was also important; such curricula can theoretically promote equity, but certain conditions may need to exist. Social justice pedagogy broadens the concept of equity work in mathematics classrooms and may help promote a more just society.</ab>

        <ab>The supposed apolitical nature of mathematics is an institutional frame that functions to sustain specific power structures within schools. This paper disrupts the common assumption that mathematics (as a body of knowledge constructed in situated historical moments) is free from entrenched ideological motives. Using narrative inquiry, the paper examines the ways in which novice mathematics teachers negotiate the intersection of curriculum and institutional politics. After outlining a theoretical framework, the paper performs a story entitled `political text' which reveals the plaintive, dissenting voice of a novice teacher as she negotiates the friction between her life history and the ossified canonicity of mathematics curriculum. Through the critical and reflexive voice of the novice teacher, the naturalized concepts of counting and measurement are playfully revisioned. The frequent silencing of such oppositional readings underscores the deeply embedded conflict between voice and text in the contemporary mathematics classroom.</ab>

        <ab>Recent research suggests that the examination of students' work may lead to changes in teaching practice that are more effective in terms of students' mathematical learning. However, the link between the examination of students' work and the teachers' actions in the classroom is largely unexamined, particularly at the secondary level. In this paper, I present the results of a study in which teachers had extensive opportunities to examine the development of students' conceptual models of exponential growth in the context of their own classrooms. I describe two related aspects of the practice of one teacher: (a) how she listened to students' alternative solution strategies and (b) how she responded to these strategies in her practice. The results of the analysis suggest that as the teacher listened to her students, she developed a sophisticated schema for understanding the diversity of student thinking. The actions of the teacher supported extensive student engagement with the task and led the students to revise and refine their own mathematical thinking. This latter action reflects a significant shift in classroom practice from the role of the teacher as evaluator of student ideas to the role of students as self-evaluators of their emerging ideas.

        <ab>This study employed a cluster randomized trial design to evaluate the effectiveness of a research-based intervention for improving the mathematics education of very young children. This intervention includes the Building Blocks mathematics curriculum, which is structured in research-based learning trajectories, and congruous professional development emphasizing teaching for understanding via learning trajectories and technology. A total of 42 schools serving low-resource communities were randomly selected and randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups using a randomized block design involving 1,375 preschoolers in 106 classrooms. Teachers implemented the intervention with adequate fidelity. Pre- to posttest scores revealed that the children in the Building Blocks group learned more mathematics than the children in the control group (effect size, g = 0.72). Specific components of a measure of the quantity and quality of classroom mathematics environments and teaching partially mediated the treatment effect.</ab>

        <ab>Research on curricular choices has attracted widespread attention and merits increased investment by the research community. Multiple studies, publications, conferences, and a multicampus center (The Show-Me Project, n.d.) speak to the need to discuss what is taught in the classrooms and to whom, how, and when. Since the 1990s, with the creation of "Standards"-based curricula, practitioners have had to choose between new and traditional curricula. In addition, the No Child Left Behind Act 2001 has put pressure on schools to use curriculum materials that are researched based and approved by the U.S. Department of Education (n.d.). These two milestones related to mathematics education justify making curricula issues an area that warrants the attention of both the research community and practitioners. The purpose of this article is to highlight advances related to curricular research; pose questions that require further investigation; and describe related, emerging subfields. First, the authors begin with a brief history of the events that have had led teachers to their current state of curricular affairs. They also explore a report released by the National Research Committee (NRC) in 2004 that challenged the research community to consider research on curricula issues differently than has been done in the past. Second, the authors discuss a recent study that illustrates the promise of new methodologies. Third, the Research committee examines evidence on how the "Standards"-based curricula have impacted diverse groups of students, since a major goal of the "Standards" documents was to ensure that all students were provided access to high-quality mathematics curricula. Fourth, as another example of progress in curriculum-related areas, the authors discuss how researchers from the teacher education have opened new subfields, in part because of the increased demands that curricular reforms have placed on teachers. Finally, the authors report the policy implications of this combination of research on curricular effectiveness in general, on issues of diversity and equity, and on the interaction of teacher knowledge and curricular reform.

The writers discuss the Preschool Learning Center of the Community Service Academy of Intermediate School 218, which is situated in a low-income, working-class neighborhood of New York City.  In the academy, students in grade 6 learn math by teaching four- and five-year-old children and planning for their needs.</ab>

        <ab>School subjects are analogous to medieval alchemy. There is a magical change as mathematics, science, and social sciences move from their disciplinary spaces into the classroom. The educational and social psychologies have little or nothing to do with understanding disciplinary practices. They are intellectual inventions for normalizing and governing the child's conduct, relationships, and communications. The author examines this alchemy in standards-based mathematics educational policy and research for K-12 schools. He argues that (a) the emphasis on “problem solving,” collaboration, and “communities of learning” sanctify science and scientists as possessing authoritative knowledge over increasing realms of human phenomena, thus narrowing the boundaries of possible action and critical thought; and (b) while reforms stress the need for educational equity for “all children,” with “no child left behind,” the pedagogical models divide, demarcate, and exclude particular children from participation.

        <ab>We provide evidence of persistent gender effects for students using advanced adaptive technology while learning mathematics. This technology improves each gender’s learning and affective predispositions toward mathematics, but specific features in the software help either female or male students. Gender differences were seen in the students’ style of use of the system, motivational goals, affective needs, and cognitive/affective benefits, as well as the impact of affective interventions involving pedagogical agents. We describe 4 studies, with hundreds of students in public schools over several years, which suggest that technology responses should probably be customized to each gender. This article shows differential results before, during, and after the use of adaptive tutoring software, indicating that digital tutoring systems can be an important supplement to mathematics classrooms but that male and female students should be addressed differently. Female students were more receptive than male students to seeking and accepting help provided by the tutoring system and to spending time seeing the hints; thus, they had a consistent general trend to benefit more from it, especially when affective learning companions were present. In addition, female students expressed positively valenced emotions most often and exhibited more productive behaviors when exposed to female characters; these affective pedagogical agents encouraged effort and perseverance. This was not the case for male students, who had more positive outcomes when no learning companion was present and their worst affective and cognitive outcomes when the female character was present.

        <ab>Diversity and equity are stated priority areas across the field of mathematics education, from the ivory towers of the academy, across teacher education programs, to school districts, schools, and individual classrooms. The talk surrounding diversity and equity is usually framed around categories of race, cultural background, language, disability status, sex, or socioeconomic status, mostly one category at a time. In general, sexual orientation and gender identity remain largely absent from these discussions. This article looks more closely at the connection of gender and sexual identity with the teaching and learning of mathematics.</ab>

        <ab>A study examined the nature and extent of the effect of mandated standardized testing on curriculum and instruction in mathematics and science for minority students.  Participants were 2,229 public school teachers of grades 4–12 in high and low minority classes, who responded to a survey addressing various aspects of testing and teaching in mathematics and science.  The study elicited three major findings:  Mathematics and science standardized tests do not reflect recommended standards but reflect low level conceptual knowledge, low level thinking skills, a lack of emphasis on procedural knowledge in science, and an overemphasis on algorithms and formulas in mathematics; the negative results reported by many educational researchers regarding the increasing role, number, and educational stakes of mandated standardized tests in U.S. classrooms are confirmed; and these negative consequences are significantly worse in classrooms with high percentages of minority students.</ab>

        <ab>A growing body of research explores theoretical models of teaching for social justice in P-12 classrooms and in teacher education. However, many of these models fail to account for the relationship between teachers’ social justice frameworks and their classroom practices. In this article, I use vignettes drawn from a recent study of secondary English Language Arts teachers to illustrate how differences in social location and sociopolitical emphasis affect teachers’ approaches to justice-oriented curriculum, pedagogy, and social action. This article concludes with implications for teaching and teacher education, including strategies for using these findings in preservice classrooms.</ab>

        <ab>This paper uses a multilevel analysis of mathematical reasoning rooted in Cultural Historical Activity Theory to examine how mathematical discourse and student reasoning about linear functions developed across 3 weeks in a ninth grade bilingual algebra class. Despite the teacher's expertise teaching with a conceptual focus, and her stated intention to focus on slope as a rate of change, the case study students in her class appeared to appropriate a procedural understanding of slope. By examining the nested activity systems of the students' group discussions, the classroom, school, and district, this analysis shows how external assessment pressures shaped the teacher's selection of tasks, her and her students' use of mathematical discourse, and ultimately, her students' opportunity to learn a critical algebraic concept.</ab>

        <ab>Creating equitable opportunities so all students can learn and succeed mathematically has been a key focus of mathematics education across several decades. Central to student achievement are students’ mathematical identity and their feelings of success during instruction. Researchers (e.g., Boaler &amp; Staples, 2008) have shown that teachers can be particularly powerful in shaping students’ beliefs, feelings of success, and achievement, but few studies have investigated how teachers frame what it means to be successful or 'smart' in mathematics. Through the social construct of smartness (Hatt, 2012) and the learning perspectives of incremental and entity theories (Blackwell, Trzesnieski, &amp; Dweck, 2007; Yeager &amp; Dweck, 2012), I examine how one teacher, Mrs. Purl, conceptualized what it meant to be smart in mathematics and how this perception changed slowly, over time, through repeated examination and discussion of individual student's thinking. As Mrs. Purl came to know her students at a personal level, she began to see that her perceptions were not always accurate and warranted reexamination.

        <ab>A study examined whether the influences of educational productivity factors on mathematics achievement and attitudes toward mathematics were the same for African-American, Native American, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and white students.  Data from students who took part in all of the first three waves of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 were analyzed.  Home environment, prior mathematics achievement, motivation, quality and quantity of instruction, classroom environment, peer influences, and use of out-of-school time were the productivity factors examined.  Findings indicated that the influence of the productivity factors on mathematics achievement and attitudes toward mathematics were not significantly different for the ethnic groups, that differences in the levels of factors influencing achievement had a significant influence on the students' achievement outcomes, and that optimizing the productivity factors had a substantial influence on mathematics achievement.  Additional results are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>This qualitative case study examined course-taking decisions among three southeastern U.S. Black high school students who opted out of honors and advanced placement (AP) classes. These honors and AP academically qualified students were defined, for the purpose of this study, as students either scored above a predetermined percentile on a standardized test or were identified by their previous classroom teachers as exhibiting the academic ability to persist in advanced level course work. Structured interviews were conducted with the students and the collected data were coded inductively through constant comparative analysis and reported as a contextsituated case study. Emergent themes included the influence of parents and peers, instructional strategies used by teachers and perceived course rigor, and cultural identity as barriers that contributed to Black students' electing to decline enrollment in honors and AP courses.</ab>

        <ab>This article provides an example of, and lessons from, teaching and learning critical mathematics in a Chicago public neighborhood high school with a social justice focus. It is based on a qualitative study of my untracked, 12th-grade mathematics class, a full-year enactment of mathematics for social and racial justice. Students were Black and Latin@ from a low-income, working-class community with a tradition of resistance. Any neighborhood student could enroll without selection criteria. The class goal was for students to cocreate a classroom in which they would learn and use collegepreparatory', conceptually based mathematics to study and understand social reality to prepare themselves to change it. Through analyzing my practice, I address possibilities and challenges of curriculum development and teaching, examine student learning, and pose questions and directions for further research and practice.</ab>

        <ab>The learning preferences of African-American students in mathematics education should be considered when forming pedagogical suggestions to accommodate their learning.  Mathematics pedagogy has typically addressed the needs of the analytic, field-independent, individual learner, but it can be modified to give students who have other learning preferences the opportunity to learn mathematics by seeking solution paths that match their learning preferences.  Suggested pedagogical practices include initiating instruction in the areas where students exhibit strengths and stretching students into thinking in ways that are culturally familiar and unfamiliar and seeking excellence within the students' culture thus enabling students to become emancipated lifelong learners.  According to a suggested culturally emancipating math curriculum, students should be taught through many cultures by being exposed to role models from their communities, seeing students like themselves in textbooks and on classroom displays, and talking about traditions and symbols of their ethnic cultures.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special issue on equity, mathematics reform, and research. A study examined the effect of a two-year multicultural education staff development program on the mathematics teaching of a group of predominantly white teachers.  Subjects were nine teachers whose mathematics instruction was observed.  The results showed that there were two consistent patterns in the way that mathematics instruction was organized in the teachers' classrooms.  First, in the majority of classrooms, the subject was organized as a discrete subject that was disconnected from other academic disciplines or real-world applications.  Second, the subject was conceptualized as a sequenced set of skills to be practiced, one skill at a time.  Textbooks, worksheets, and chalkboard were the most favored teaching resources. Individual seatwork and recitation were overwhelmingly favored as teaching strategies.  For the most part, the teachers framed mathematics as a set of skills that was neither connected to other disciplines nor developed from children's experiences.</ab>

        <ab>This study focused on four Black American women undergraduate seniors attending a predominantly white research institution (PWI) in the southeastern United States. Participants who initially majored in the biology pre-professional degree program shared experiences that impacted their decision to switch their major, and in most cases, their career aspirations in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The current study used phenomological case-study techniques which incorporated individual, semi-structured interviews, and a demographic questionnaire to obtain participants’ perspectives. Additionally, researchers utilized traditional data analysis, coding, and thematic category development and interpretation techniques to develop themes, conclusions, and implications for this research. The most salient factors that impacted their decision to change majors included: a) lack of early success in science at the predominantly white institution, b) lack of adequate career counseling and advisement, and c) feelings of lack of adequate preparation for science in the college classroom based on their precollege science and mathematics course experiences. Ultimately these factors impacted the Black American women undergraduate students’ lack of persistence in their original science degree programs on the college level.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special issue on recruiting, preparing, and retaining qualified teachers to educate all children.  An adaptation of a presentation given at the 1999 American Educational Research Association meeting.  A study examined the effects of time and experience on preservice teachers' attitudes and beliefs about their sense of efficacy as well as their knowledge of mathematics and assessment reform efforts.  Participants were 15 preservice teachers in a master's degree-teacher certification program in elementary education.  Results revealed that time increased participants' sense of efficacy for some areas and decreased it for other areas, although not significantly.  Participants' confidence in classroom management seemed to increase over time and with experience, but their confidence in their ability to help students to experience success and self-worth in some areas decreased.  Overall, however, participants had a high sense of personal efficacy.  Results also showed that participants felt better prepared to teach in an educational reform setting following their exposure to information on and discussion of recent curricular and assessment changes.</ab>

        <ab>Part of a special issue on technology and the culture of classrooms. The writer examines the potential for convergence of the multicultural equity and technology agendas.  Although both agendas are pursued simultaneously, they are pursued almost totally independently of each other.  Moreover, although the bases of both technological and multicultural pedagogies are, in many ways, remote from each other, there is an apparent parallelism in some of their key principles. This parallelism centers on the rejection of student accumulation of preselected facts as the driving mode of education and the assertion that the social organization of the classroom must change in ways that both displace the authority of the teacher as a dispenser of all valuable knowledge and disrupt the traditional hierarchies that determine who succeeds in school.</ab>

        <ab>This article identifies instructional strategies, curricula, and organizational structures in the research literature that have been successful in encouraging girls' participation and achievement in science: science instruction in pre-kindergarten and kindergarten, relevant curricula that address girls' interests and provide opportunities for genuine inquiry and tinkering experiences, greater emphasis on physical science and the use of computers, integration of reading and writing in science, attention to how groups are formed in classrooms, activities that build self-efficacy, appropriate role models, messages that science is for everyone, and student-centered teaching. Special attention is given to the needs of children in preschool and kindergarten. In addition, research on the impact of single-sex classrooms and grouping is reviewed, along with the use of children's fictional literature to teach science. Implications derived from research literature include changes in what is taught, how it is taught, how teachers are prepared, and how these changes are paid for.</ab>

        <ab>All science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educators working in urban public school systems are expected to provide opportunities for students to develop foundational scientific literacy skills in mathematics and science learning. However, the demands on STEM educators teaching the “gifted” or “high-performing” students attending STEM-focused schools are much higher. Educators are expected to motivate, nurture, and propel the intrinsic or earned abilities these students possess. This article shares teaching- and learning-informed stories of a STEM educator (the author) and her students attending New York City Specialized High School for the Sciences. The goal is to document the complexities surrounding the notion of a gifted mindset: first from the author's own experiences as a female scientist and person of color and second from the narratives of the students. Teaching and learning within a prestigious public school for the sciences comes with many narratives of challenge and triumph. The learning stories of empowered students reveal that they desire opportunities in the STEM classroom for meaningful learning. Students who want to take ownership in their learning will find a way to appropriate meaningful learning, even in restrictive classrooms. Learning stories, as a theoretical framework and narrative assessment tool, are particularly useful in contextualizing the multi-dimensional aspects of being a STEM professional in education.</ab>

        <ab>The authors examined rates of both teacher responsiveness and student participation in the classroom question-asking context. Participants were 165 students and their teachers in 6 science classrooms. Teachers in 3 of the 6 classrooms called on male students to answer questions more often than would have been expected on the basis of the number of boys in the classroom. In none of the classrooms, however, did teachers call on boys more often than would be expected on the basis of the heightened volunteering rates of their male students. No systematic sex or achievement-level differences were found in the types of questions that students responded to. These findings suggest the need to focus on the role that both teachers and their students play in creating and maintaining sex differences in the teacher–student interaction context.

        <ab>Part of a special issue on class in education.  A study examined the compounding impact of race and class on two girls' everyday experience of learning mathematics.  Participants were two sixth-grade female students in an advanced mathematics class, one of whom was a high-achieving Caucasian girl from a middle- or upper-middle-class family and one of whom was a high-achieving African-American girl from a working-class background.  Results suggested a relationship between class, race, and gender issues in mathematics education.  In particular, results revealed how evaluation and expectation of a student's academic potential in these participants' mathematics classroom were based on observed dispositions of students, based on a white, middle-class culture and value system.</ab>

        <ab>A special issue on mathematics and gender features articles on the link between selected cognitive and affective factors and gender differences in mathematics achievement, the relationship between students' attitudes toward mathematics and their perceptions of factors in the classroom environment, the interaction between affective and cognitive variables in learning situations, the definition of a new epistemological position in mathematics, a program that was designed to alter teachers' attitudes and classroom practices in a setting (Botswana) where gender and mathematical issues usually have a low priority, how socioeconomic background and gender might affect perceptions of mathematics and result in conflicting demands, and a model of inclusive mathematics education that addresses the four dialectical aspects of silence/speech, passivity/active participation, powerlessness/empowerment, and omission/inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>Part of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' 1997 yearbook on multicultural and gender equity in the math classroom.  The writers describe a high school math teacher as she attempts to teach meaningful math to inner-city students in her bilingual classes.  In her attempts, the teacher uses the diversity of her classroom to resolve the tension between the constructivist and sociocultural perspectives of learning math and to propel exploration in math.</ab>

        <ab>The authors draw from the research literature and from their work with the Scientific Literacy Project (SLP) in kindergarten classrooms to address the inclusion of science picture books in the curriculum. They describe features and functions of informational texts, discuss teachers' common concerns about providing young children with experiences to engage with informational science texts, and present evidence that addresses these concerns. They show how teacher support and guidance encourage classroom dialogue and facilitate children's cognitive and affective engagement with both literacy and science.</ab>

        <ab>The literature on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is abounding with the importance of increasing college access, retention, and persistence among students because of implications for America's global competitiveness. Particular emphasis has been placed on college students of color who remain underrepresented in STEM education. Therefore, increasing college access, retention, and persistence for students of color in STEM is not merely a matter of United States' economic competitiveness, but also a matter of equity. Using in-depth interview methods, this article delineates factors facilitating the retention and persistence of students of color in STEM education at a predominantly White institution. Implications for institutional practice and research are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Reviews the book Meaningful Urban Educational Reform: Confronting the Learning Crisis in Mathematics and Science by Kathryn M. Borman and Associates (2005). With the ongoing concern to improve the learning of mathematics in urban environments and with the concomitant interest in equity and in closing the achievement gap, this book is a useful contribution to the literature. The research on which the report is based spans a 3-year study of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Urban Systemic Initiative. Borman and her seven associates 'provide compelling portraits of classrooms, teachers, and students in elementary, middle, and high schools through case studies and examples from intensive research in four locations, namely Chicago, El Paso, Memphis, and Miami. The research methodology in terms of the NSF Six-Driver Model is stringent, the writing is lucid, and the book has the potential to be useful to all involved in reforming mathematics education in urban environments.

        <ab>[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 109(1) of Journal of Educational Psychology (see record [rid]2016-23265-001[/rid]). In this article, the sixth sentence of the Relations of Challenge and Support subsection of the Results section should read 'Results from a baseline null cross-classified model indicated that 53% of the variance in engagement occurred between cell (cross-classification of student and instructional episode), about 37% occurred between-students, and about 10% was attributed to instructional episode.'] This study explored associations between students’ perceptions of challenge, teacher-provided support and obstruction, and students’ momentary academic engagement in high school science classrooms. Instrumental and emotional dimensions of support and obstruction were examined separately, and analyses tested whether the relationship between challenge and engagement was moderated by teacher support, teacher obstruction, and individual characteristics like gender and grade level. Students’ perceptions of challenge were positively related to their momentary reports of engagement in science learning activities, while teachers’ instrumental support was positively associated with engagement across all levels of perceived challenge. Even though teachers’ provision of emotional support was not predictive of student engagement, teachers’ emotional obstruction was negatively associated with student engagement. Teachers’ instrumental obstruction had less consistent associations with student engagement, and was only associated with declines in engagement during those moments when students perceived greater challenge in class. Both gender and grade level emerged as moderators of the relationship between challenge and engagement. Results are discussed in terms of implications for future research and instructional practice.

        <ab>This article describes how teachers in a professional development course responded to what they noticed about children's participation in elementary mathematics classrooms and how what they noticed was connected to the teachers' positionality toward equitable mathematics pedagogy. Findings suggest that a lens of participation supported teachers as they considered how to provide more equitable mathematics instruction. Further, the depth to which teachers noticed children's participation was connected to their positionality as equitable mathematics educators.</ab>

        <ab>The writer introduces the second part on “Cultural and Societal Issues” as part of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics yearbook.  This section explores the various ways that cultural and societal dynamics affect students’ motivation to learn mathematics.  The culture of the mathematics classroom in light of how it affects students’ attitudes and beliefs about mathematics and their future careers is examined.  Embedded in this section is the importance of equitable sharing of material and human resources; intellectually challenging curricula; educational experiences that build on students’ cultures, languages, home experiences, and identities; and pedagogies that prepare students to engage in critical thought and democratic participation in society.</ab>

        <ab>The lack of strong literacy skills and practices among students is perhaps the clearest indicator that the education system continues to leave millions of children behind. To advance the reading, writing, and speaking skills of middle and high school students, this study examines a professional development model that brought trained community-based poets into the classroom to conduct weekly writing workshops. Over the course of two years, poet-mentor educators worked alongside 30 English Language Arts and Special Education teachers, reaching over 800 students. When the literacy program entered its second year, issues of propriety and language usages unveiled deep rifts between who students were as individuals and who educators wanted them to be as learners. The literature on multiple literacies and cultural relevancy helped frame the professional development within a larger movement to bring student voices and experiences into the curriculum (e.g., Gay, 2000; Ladson-Billings, 1994, 1995; Mahiri, 1998a, 1998b), but even this scholarship does not address the contentious interplay between student self-expression, conformity, and academic achievement. So what happens when students' poetry embodies inner-city street vernacular and volatile subject matter that offends teachers? To address this concern, my research analyzes how to use spoken word poetry as a form of critical literacy development and empowerment within the confines of school.</ab>

        <ab>This study examined the demographic, pre-college, environmental, and college factors that impact students’ interests in and decisions to earn a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) degree among students attending a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). Results indicated that Hispanic students were well represented among STEM majors, and students’ decisions to declare a STEM major and earn a STEM degree were uniquely influenced by students’ gender, ethnicity, SAT math score, and high school percentile. Earning a STEM degree was related to students’ first-semester GPA and enrollment in mathematics and science 'gatekeeper' courses. Findings indicate that HSIs may be an important point of access for students in STEM fields and may also provide opportunity for more equitable outcomes for Hispanic students.

        <ab>The author highlights the article entitled "Principles and Standards for School Mathematics." He stated that the article is one of his favorite because it conveys that mathematics teaching and learning is improved when using multiple approaches in understanding important skills and procedures, concepts and relationships. The article also identifies six principles that influence the selection of curriculum materials, the planning of instructional units or lessons and instructional decisions in the classroom. The principles include, equity, teaching and learning.</ab>

A study explored how students' class backgrounds might influence their mathematical thinking and learning.  Participants were 18 seventh graders of various socioeconomic backgrounds who provided information on their thinking about mathematical claims in the media.  The results are discussed in relation to students' beliefs about the nature of research, students' interpretation of media claims, and the influence of claims.</ab>

        <ab>The author reported research findings from a study that critically examined the role of sociocultural orientations in the mathematical experiences of 2 African American students. To determine how the orientations influenced the students' mathematical success, the author used a phenomenological research strategy to examine the life histories of the students. The author highlighted the African American students' perceptions of and responses to their mathematical experiences by emphasizing their experiences in mathematics classrooms. Results of the study suggest that the ways in which students perceive and respond to schooling influence their success in mathematics. Data also suggest that African American students do not perceive and respond to schooling in the same way by virtue of being African American, thus implying that African American students may belong to many different cultures. Finally, the results of the study suggest that the ways in which African American students view (a) membership in particular cultures, (b) caring educators, and (c) role models influence their mathematical success.

        <ab>ABSTRACT Mathematical skill level, classroom behavior, and effort of 512 students were rated by 15 third-grade teachers and 14 fifth-grade teachers. Of those students, 464 completed mathematics and reading achievement tests. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to measure the relationship between student gender and teacher perceptions of their mathematics proficiency. In both third and fifth grades, regression results showed that mathematics and reading achievement test scores, together with student effort, were significant predictors of teacher rating of student mathematics achievement. Gender was not a significant contributor in either grade. Similar results were found when students were split by general or special education. The findings suggest that the teachers did not consider student gender when rating the mathematics skill level of their students.</ab>

        <ab>In this study, we analyzed how secondary school tracking relates to students’ self-beliefs (i.e., their academic self-concepts in different domains and their beliefs regarding their labor market chances) and school disengagement during a time period that has received little attention in educational psychological research on tracking: when students are at the end of schooling and on the verge of entering the labor market. In doing so, we disentangled 2 distinguishing features of tracking: tracks as social contexts (operationalized via track level and the mean achievement of students’ schoolmates) and tracks as pathways to different future opportunities (operationalized via educational certificates). Using questionnaire, achievement, and administrative school data from 2,155 students from 29 low-track schools, 23 intermediate-track schools, and 35 comprehensive schools in Berlin, Germany, we found educational certificates to be the most important factor shaping students’ self-beliefs and school disengagement. Irrespective of their individual achievement, their schoolmates’ achievement, and their track level, students who received the intermediate school-leaving certificate had higher academic self-concepts, believed that their certificate would give them better chances of success in the labor market, and were less disengaged from school than students who received the low school-leaving certificate. In contrast, students’ track level did not serve as a predictor for the outcomes considered. The achievement of students’ schoolmates (i.e., the big-fish-little-pond effect) was only relevant for students’ academic self-concepts and not for students’ self-beliefs regarding labor market entry or their school disengagement.

        <ab>The article reports on the classroom activity called "Slicing a Cube" which provide students with wide mathematical questions and arguments related to algebra and geometry through deciding whether plane figures will be obtained when a plane slices through a cube. Its needed materials include clear plastic cubes, water, roll of paper towels and plenty of rubber bands. It starts with providing the students with a list of geometric figures and drawings of cubes and then they will be asked by the teacher to create each figure by drawing a plane as it slices through a cube. The activity is also best used in teaching students about polygon.</ab>

        <ab>The effective integration of African American students into previously segregated careers was one of the main goals of the Brown decision and, in turn, the outcomes of such efforts have been the subject of much scholarly interest). This qualitative study, drawing on critical race theorist Derrick Bell's critique of Brown, makes the case for applying culturally relevant pedagogy theory (CRPT) to positively impact student achievement and career choice, particularly as it relates to the STEM field of computing sciences. Cultural barriers such as early exposure to technology, students ' perceptions of their own potential in the field, and the lack of culturally relevant social support, often deter African American students from pursuing careers in STEM fields, particularly computing sciences. Although there is a dearth in the literature regarding how to expand the pipeline to computing sciences using culturally specific practices, this study produced results that suggest culturally responsive practices as an effective method for broadening participation in computing. Using CRPT, this qualitative study identifies culturally relevant practices that positively affect the persistence of African Americans in the STEM field of computing science.</ab>

An ethnographic study investigated African-American students' beliefs and ideas about math.  Participants were 17 African-American students in grades 9–12.  The results revealed that students' perceptions of math were intricately related to their surroundings at home, in school, and in their communities.  Moreover, the results suggest that teachers can have a profound effect on the self-image of African-American math students.</ab>

        <ab>The topic of this paper is mathematical identity or self-concept. This elusive construct is explored through two classroom episodes, in the public domain of whole classwork, in a senior high-school class. The structures in the dialogue in both episodes could constitute enhancement of self-concept for some students and mediate against the confidence in mathematics of others, but intersecting effects of students’ one-to-one conversations are shown to be important to final outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>The focus of this study was connections among 3 aspects of mathematical cognition at 2nd grade: calculations, word problems, and prealgebraic knowledge. We extended the literature, which is dominated by correlational work, by examining whether intervention conducted on calculations or word problems contributes to improved performance in the other domain and whether intervention in either or both domains contributes to prealgebraic knowledge. Participants were 1,102 children in 127 second-grade classrooms in 25 schools. Teachers were randomly assigned to 3 conditions: calculation intervention, word-problem intervention, and business-as-usual control. Intervention, which lasted 17 weeks, was designed to provide research-based linkages between arithmetic calculations or arithmetic word problems (depending on condition) and prealgebraic knowledge. Multilevel modeling suggested calculation intervention improved calculation but not word-problem outcomes; word-problem intervention enhanced word-problem but not calculation outcomes; and word-problem intervention provided a stronger route than calculation intervention to prealgebraic knowledge.

        <ab>Ruby Payne, CEO of aha! Process, Inc., and author of A Framework for Understanding Poverty (2005), has become one of the most influential figures in the U.S. public education milieu. Payne's framework, built largely upon understanding the "culture" of poverty, instructs educators on the values and mindsets poor students carry into the classroom as well as how to help them develop middle-class values and culture. But despite Payne's popularity, scholars and activists representing a wide variety of disciplines, from critical theory to mathematics education, have been highly critical of her work. In this essay I synthesize the existing critiques, dividing them into "eight elements of oppression" in Payne's work. I then offer a vision for a more authentic framework - one for authenticating anti-poverty education.</ab>

        <ab>A study examined the effectiveness of a standards-based method of teaching designed to improve the achievement of at-risk students in a Native American mathematics classroom.  Participants were 31 eighth-grade Native American students of mathematics at a reservation middle school in the Southwest.  Findings revealed that participants taught through the standards-based method of mathematics instruction achieved more than participants who received traditional instruction in mathematics.  The retention test scores of participants who had received standards-based instruction were almost as good as their scores on the achievement test, while the retention scores of the other participants dropped significantly from their achievement scores.  Other findings of the study are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>A study examined the building of self-esteem in at-risk minority youths through a creative approach to teaching mathematics and science.  A group of 483 pre-adolescent youths from low-income urban families participated in the summer component of the Teaching Excellence for Minority Student Achievement in the Sciences (TEMSAS) program.  The essence of the TEMSAS program was to raise self-esteem and personal expectations of low-achieving minority students through the vehicle of mathematics and science.  Findings revealed that the culmination of the TEMSAS summer session resulted in approximately 300 African-American and Latino pre-adolescent youths, who were at-risk of academic failure before the program, possibly becoming more confident and interested in studying science.  It is concluded that the TEMSAS program for urban, minority, low-income youth is an excellent model that can be, and was, replicated by classroom teachers to reduce behavior that may cause students to fail academically.</ab>

        <ab>A study examined when and how students gain ownership in science learning.  Data were collected over three school years and six 7th grade science classes in an urban middle school in New York City.  Two vignettes are offered to demonstrate how students fostered ownership in the school science setting, how this supported students' engagement in science class, and how particular “ownership structures” supported students' development of ownership.  Findings showed that it is possible to promote spaces of student ownership within the framework of the formal science classroom that results to increased and deeper student engagement.  There are many dimensions to what students “won” within the framework of the science classroom.</ab>

        <ab>As the United States becomes more racially and ethnically diverse and draws more students from across the globe, more representative data are needed to understand at-risk and underrepresented populations in higher education, particularly in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The authors argue that the current reporting standards for the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) result in the misrepresentation of racial and ethnic populations in STEM by forcing non-U.S. students into a 'master status' category regardless of their racial or ethnic group membership. This study uses data from IPEDS and the American Community Survey to estimate the possible misrepresentation of reported bachelor degree completions by racial and ethnic group and citizenship status in the biological and biomedical sciences and engineering. We found that nearly all of the racial and ethnic groups in IPEDS may be significantly misreported because of the reporting standards for U.S. citizenship. With these findings, various implications are discussed, including higher education decision-making policies; interpretation of academic and social experiences of diverse peoples (race, ethnicity, and nationality); and creation of effective structures for academic success, particularly for students of color, regardless of citizenship.

        <ab>Surveyed 1,089 male and 1,124 female high school seniors about their academic and career choices (CCs) and the perceived influences on those choices. This study complements earlier results of S. Rallis and S. Ahern (1986). Parents and teachers influenced CC more often for Ss choosing careers in engineering and science (ES). Pay was an important factor in CCs for males in general, and genuine interest was a more important factor for females not choosing careers in ES. These gender differences disappear among Ss with extremely strong mathematics and science coursework background. Teachers may play a particularly important role in influencing the CCs of females. Equity of access and encouragement in math and science is certainly a necessary, but insufficient, condition for improving the representation of women in ES.
